# Teia Output Directory

This directory contains packaged aesthetic.computer pieces ready for upload to Teia.

## Structure

Each piece gets its own subdirectory and zip file:
```
output/
├── starfield/              # Unpacked directory
│   ├── index.html         # Entry point
│   ├── cover.svg          # Cover image
│   └── aesthetic.computer/ # AC system files
└── starfield.zip          # Ready for Teia upload
```

## Usage

The output files are generated by running:
```bash
./pack-for-teia.sh piece-name
```

Upload the `.zip` files to [teia.art/mint](https://teia.art/mint) to create Interactive OBJKTs.
