# ðŸŽ„ Merry Pipelin### 1. Basic Pipeli### 2. Custom Dur### 3. Mixed Du### 4. Early Stop Command
```
stop
merry:stop
```
- Stop the pipeline at any time
- Immediately returns to prompt
- Cleans up system state
- Progress bar disappears```
merry tone:3 clock wand:2
```
- Mix custom and default durations
- Pieces without `:duration` use the 5-second default
- Progress bar updates smoothly

### 4. Early Stop Commandntax
```
merry tone:3 clock:5 wand:2
```
- Specify duration in seconds using `piece:duration` format
- Each piece can have its own custom duration
- Duration is in seconds (not milliseconds or frames)
- Progress bar shows overall progress

### 3. Mixed Durations
```
merry tone clock wand
```
- Chains pieces together
- Default 5 seconds per piece
- Automatically transitions between pieces
- Returns to prompt when complete
- Shows green progress bar at top

### 2. Custom Duration Syntax Implementation Summary

## What Was Built
A new command system called "merry" that allows you to chain aesthetic.computer pieces together in a pipeline with configurable durations, similar to how the tape system works but for sequential playback.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Visual Progress Bar Overlay
```
[===green===][=>cyan......][...orange...][....pink....]
```
- 1px tall segmented progress bar at the **top** of the screen
- Each segment represents one piece in the pipeline
- Segment width proportional to piece duration
- Color-coded segments (6-color cycling palette)
- **Completed pieces**: Full bright color (steady)
- **Current piece**: Bright with pulse + white leader pixel
- **Upcoming pieces**: Dim preview (15% brightness)
- Shows time-remaining visually via segment fill
- Automatically appears when merry is running
- Disappears when pipeline completes

### 2. Basic Pipeline Syntax
```
merry tone clock wand
```
- Chains pieces together
- Default 5 seconds per piece
- Automatically transitions between pieces
- Returns to prompt when complete

### 2. Custom Duration Syntax
```
merry tone:3 clock:5 wand:2
```
- Specify duration in seconds using `piece:duration` format
- Each piece can have its own custom duration
- Duration is in seconds (not milliseconds or frames)

### 3. Mixed Durations
```
merry tone:3 clock wand:2
```
- Mix custom and default durations
- Pieces without `:duration` use the 5-second default

### 4. Merryo Infinite Loop
```
merryo 0.25-tone
```
- Repeats the pipeline from the beginning forever
- Progress bar cycles continuously
- Exit with `stop` / `merry:stop`

### 5. Early Stop Command
```
stop
merry:stop
```
- Stop the pipeline at any time
- Immediately returns to prompt
- Cleans up system state

## How It Works

### Pipeline Parsing
1. Splits each parameter by `:` to extract piece name and duration
2. Uses default 5 seconds if no duration specified
3. Validates that duration is a positive number
4. Builds an array of `{ piece, duration }` objects

### Execution Flow
1. Stores pipeline in `system.merry` object
2. Starts with first piece (index 0)
3. Uses `setTimeout` to schedule next piece
4. Calls `jump(piece)` to navigate to each piece
5. Increments index and repeats
6. Returns to prompt after last piece

### State Management
```javascript
system.merry = {
  pipeline: [{ piece, duration }, ...],
  currentIndex: 0,
  running: true
}
```

## Code Changes

### File: `/workspaces/aesthetic-computer/system/public/aesthetic.computer/disks/prompt.mjs`

#### 1. Documentation (lines ~5-12)
Added README section explaining merry system usage

#### 2. Main Command Handler (lines ~377-450)
- Detects `slug === "merry"`
- Parses parameters
- Builds pipeline with total duration tracking
- Implements recursive piece chaining with progress tracking
- Uses `setTimeout` for timing
- Updates progress state for progress bar
- Handles completion and cleanup

#### 3. Stop Command (lines ~545-557)
- Detects `slug === "merry:stop"` or `slug === "stop"`
- Stops running pipeline
- Cleans up system state
- Returns to prompt

### File: `/workspaces/aesthetic-computer/system/public/aesthetic.computer/lib/disk.mjs`

#### 1. Progress Bar Rendering (lines ~10147-10250)
- Checks for `system.merry` state
- Calculates progress based on elapsed time
- Calculates per-piece progress for current segment
- Creates 1px tall **segmented** progress bar painting
- Each segment colored differently (6-color palette)
- Shows completed (bright), current (pulsing), upcoming (dim)
- Positions at y=0 (top of screen)
- Implements glow effects and white leader pixel
- Adds to `sendData.merryProgressBar`

#### 2. Buffer Transfer (lines ~11248-11253)
- Creates copy of merry progress bar buffer
- Adds to transferred objects for main thread

### File: `/workspaces/aesthetic-computer/system/public/aesthetic.computer/bios.mjs`

#### 1. Overlay Registration (line ~11247)
- Adds `buildOverlay("merryProgressBar", content.merryProgressBar)`

#### 2. Overlay Painting (lines ~11457-11466)
- Paints merry progress bar immediately on every frame
- Positioned at top of screen (before tape progress bar)

#### 3. Cache Exclusions (multiple locations)
- Excludes merryProgressBar from all caching
- Forces regeneration every frame for smooth animation
- Similar to tapeProgressBar treatment

## Examples

### Your Original Request
```
merry tone:3 clock:5
```
âœ… tone piece for 3 seconds
âœ… clock piece for 5 seconds
âœ… returns to prompt

### Additional Examples
```
merry line oval rect           # Each for 5s (default)
merry tone:2 clock:3 wand:1    # Custom durations
merry starfield:10             # Single piece for 10s
```

## Technical Details

### Timing Mechanism
- Uses JavaScript `setTimeout` for scheduling
- Duration converted to milliseconds: `duration * 1000`
- Timer is cancelled if pipeline is stopped

### State Checking
- Each timer checks `system.merry.running` before proceeding
- Prevents transitions after stop command
- Cleans up `system.merry` object when done

### Error Handling
- Validates that at least one piece is provided
- Shows red flash + notice if no pieces
- Returns early to prevent execution

## Testing Suggestions

### Basic Tests
1. `merry tone clock` - Should play each for 5s
2. `merry tone:3 clock:5` - Should respect custom durations
3. `stop` - Should interrupt immediately

### Edge Cases
1. `merry` - Should show error (no pieces)
2. `merry tone:0` - Should skip (0 duration not valid)
3. `merry tone:abc` - Should use default (NaN becomes default)

## Console Output
The system logs helpful debug information:
```
ðŸŽ„ Merry pipeline: [{piece: "tone", duration: 3}, ...]
ðŸŽ„ Merry: Playing tone for 3s (1/2)
ðŸŽ„ Merry: Playing clock for 5s (2/2)
ðŸŽ„ Merry pipeline complete!
```

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Potential Additions
- Visual progress indicator showing current piece
- Pause/resume functionality
- Loop mode: `merry:loop tone clock`
- Speed modifier: `merry:2x tone clock` (2x speed)
- Frame-based timing: `merry tone:30f` (30 frames)
- Save/load pipelines: `merry:save myshow`

### Integration Ideas
- Combine with tape: Record a merry pipeline
- Combine with KidLisp: `merry $code1 $code2`
- Interactive editing: Scrub through pipeline
- Timeline view: Visual editor for sequences
