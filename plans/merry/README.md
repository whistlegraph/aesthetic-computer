# Merry Documentation Index

This directory collects the Merry planning and reference materials:

- `MERRY_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` – high-level overview of the Merry pipeline.
- `MERRY_EXAMPLES.md` – detailed usage walkthroughs and sample scripts.
- `MERRY_FLOW_DIAGRAM.txt` – text-based visualization of the execution flow.
- `MERRY_QUICK_REFERENCE.txt` – command cheatsheet for quick lookup.
- `MERRY_PROGRESS_BAR_VISUAL.txt` – ASCII representation of the progress bar concept.
- `MERRY_SEGMENTED_PROGRESS_FEATURE.md` – design notes for segmented progress tracking.

These documents were relocated from the repository root to keep plans organized in one place.
