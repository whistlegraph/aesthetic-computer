ðŸŽ„ MERRY PIPELINE - QUICK REFERENCE
===================================

## What is Merry?
A command system for chaining aesthetic.computer pieces together in a sequence,
with a segmented colored progress bar showing each piece and time remaining.

## Visual Progress Bar
[===green===][=>cyan......][...orange...]
 ^completed   ^current      ^upcoming

- Top of screen (1px tall)
- Each segment = one piece
- Width = duration proportion
- Colors cycle through palette
- Shows time remaining visually

## Syntax

### Basic (Default 5s per piece)
```
merry piece1 piece2 piece3
```

### Custom Durations
```
merry piece1:3 piece2:5 piece3:2
```
(durations in seconds)

### Mixed
```
merry piece1:3 piece2 piece3:7
```
(piece2 uses default 5s)

## Your Original Example
```
merry tone:3 clock:5
```
âœ“ Plays 'tone' for 3 seconds
âœ“ Then plays 'clock' for 5 seconds  
âœ“ Returns to prompt

## Stop Command
```
stop
```
or
```
merry:stop
```

## Record with Tape
```
tape merry tone:3 clock:5
```
- Records the entire pipeline
- Auto-calculates duration (8s)
- Auto-cuts when merry ends
- Jumps to video for export

2. Builds a pipeline queue
3. Jumps to each piece in sequence
4. Waits the specified duration
5. Automatically moves to next piece
6. Returns to prompt when done

## Default Duration
