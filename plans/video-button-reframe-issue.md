# Video Reframe Issue - Compositing Stack Investigation

**Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Updated:** 2025-10-20 (Refocused on actual issue)  
**Problem:** Screen buffer freezes between reframes when `rec.present()` is enabled  
**Status:** � IN PROGRESS - Compositing stack issue in bios.mjs, NOT button repositioning

---

## 🎯 ACTUAL ISSUE (2025-10-20)

### Corrected Problem Statement

The issue is **NOT about button repositioning** - buttons work fine and reposition correctly.

**The real problem:** During tape playback (`rec.present()` enabled), the screen buffer **temporarily freezes** when the window is resized. This causes:
- Brief animation pause during dimension sync
- Dimension mismatch between canvas and imageData
- Multiple rapid reframe cycles before stabilizing

**Root cause location:** The bios.mjs compositing stack, specifically around lines 11920-12520 where imageData is created and composited to canvas during underlayFrame (tape playback) mode.

## 🔍 Cleaned Up Logging (2025-10-20)

### Logs Removed

**video.mjs:**
- ❌ Removed: `"✅ Buttons created at screen: X x Y"`
- ❌ Removed: `"🎨 VIDEO PAINT: returning true"`  
- ❌ Removed: `"🎨 VIDEO PAINT: returning true (no buttons yet)"`

**bios.mjs:**
- ❌ Removed: `"🔄 REFRAME PATH (fallback)"`
- ❌ Removed: `"📸 VIDEO: Created imageData in normal path"`
- ❌ Removed: `"🚫 BLOCKED: imageData creation blocked"`
- ❌ Removed: `"🔄 REFRAME PATH (main)"`
- ❌ Removed: `"🎬 VIDEO: pixelsDidChange = ..."`

**disk.mjs:**
- ❌ Removed: `"🖌️ WIPE: Using screen dimensions X x Y"` (fired every frame)

### Logs Kept/Updated

**bios.mjs:**
- ✅ `"⏸️ REFRAME: Dimension mismatch during tape playback. Canvas: X x Y | ImageData: X x Y"`
  - Only logs during dimension mismatch (the freeze condition)
  - Shows exactly what dimensions don't match

**disk.mjs:**
- ✅ `"📐 REFRAME: Worker dimensions updated X x Y → X x Y"`
  - Only logs when dimensions actually change
  - Shows the transition clearly

### Expected Log Pattern

**Normal reframe (working correctly):**
```
📐 REFRAME: Worker dimensions updated 300 x 197 → 300 x 215
[smooth continuation - no freeze]
```

**Problematic reframe (freeze condition):**
```
⏸️ REFRAME: Dimension mismatch during tape playback. Canvas: 300 x 197 | ImageData: 300 x 211
⏸️ REFRAME: Dimension mismatch during tape playback. Canvas: 300 x 197 | ImageData: 300 x 211
[repeats multiple times - THIS IS THE FREEZE]
📐 REFRAME: Worker dimensions updated 300 x 197 → 300 x 215
[freeze ends - animation resumes]
```

## 📊 Pipeline Flow During Reframe

### What Should Happen

1. **User resizes window**
2. **Bios detects resize** → sends `"reframed"` message to worker
3. **Worker updates dimensions** → `screen.width/height` updated immediately
4. **Worker paints** → uses new dimensions in wipe/paint
5. **Worker sends pixels** → buffer matches new canvas size
6. **Bios receives pixels** → imageData dimensions match canvas
7. **Bios composites** → putImageData succeeds, overlays paint
8. ✅ **Animation continues smoothly**

### What Actually Happens (Freeze Condition)

1. **User resizes window**
2. **Bios detects resize** → canvas resizes immediately
3. **Bios sends `"reframed"`** → but worker hasn't processed yet
4. **Worker still painting** → using OLD dimensions
5. **Worker sends pixels** → buffer has OLD dimensions
6. **Bios receives pixels** → imageData.width !== canvas.width ❌
7. **Bios BLOCKS rendering** → `⏸️ REFRAME: Dimension mismatch` logged
8. **Bios requests repaint** → setTimeout needs-paint
9. **[Steps 4-8 repeat]** → THIS IS THE FREEZE LOOP
10. **Worker finally processes reframe** → `📐 REFRAME: Worker dimensions updated`
11. **Worker paints with new dimensions** → buffer matches canvas
12. **Bios receives matching pixels** → compositing succeeds
13. ✅ **Animation resumes**

### The Freeze Duration

The freeze lasts for the number of frames it takes for:
- The worker to receive the `"reframed"` message
- The worker to process it and update dimensions
- The worker to complete a paint cycle with new dimensions
- The bios to receive the matching buffer

Typically **10-30 frames** (shown in your logs as ~30 repetitions of the mismatch message).

## 🔬 Investigation Findings (2025-10-20)

### Worker Message Queue Analysis

**Architecture discovered:**
```javascript
// disk.mjs line 7207
onmessage = makeFrame;

async function makeFrame({ data: { type, content } }) {
  // Sequential if-else chain, no queue
  if (type === "init-from-bios") { /* ... */ return; }
  if (type === "needs-paint") { noPaint = false; return; }
  if (type === "reframed") {
    // Lines 8234-8260: Updates dimensions immediately
    screen.width = content.width;
    screen.height = content.height;
    screen.pixels = new Uint8ClampedArray(content.width * content.height * 4);
    reframed = true;
    return; // Early return - doesn't paint
  }
  if (type === "frame") { /* Main paint loop */ }
  // ...
}
```

**Key findings:**

1. **No message priority system** - Messages processed in arrival order
2. **Reframe returns early** - Updates dimensions but doesn't trigger paint
3. **Next "frame" message** - Uses new dimensions for paint
4. **The delay:** The time between:
   - Bios sends `"reframed"` message
   - Worker receives and processes it (updates dimensions)
   - Bios sends `"needs-paint"` 
   - Worker receives and processes it
   - Worker completes paint with new dimensions
   - Worker sends buffer back to bios
   - Bios receives matching buffer

### Message Flow During Reframe

**Timeline:**
```
T+0ms:   User resizes window
T+0ms:   Bios canvas resizes (synchronous DOM)
T+0ms:   Bios sends "reframed" message
T+0ms:   Bios sends "needs-paint" message
T+0ms:   Worker painting frame N with OLD dimensions
T+16ms:  Worker completes frame N, sends OLD buffer
T+16ms:  Bios receives OLD buffer → MISMATCH #1
T+16ms:  Bios setTimeout → sends "needs-paint"
T+16ms:  Worker processes "reframed" → updates dimensions
T+16ms:  Worker processes "needs-paint" → noPaint = false
T+32ms:  Worker paints frame N+1 with NEW dimensions
T+32ms:  Worker sends NEW buffer
T+32ms:  Bios receives NEW buffer → MATCH! ✅
```

**Actual freeze duration: ~1-2 frames** (16-32ms)

But because each mismatch triggers another paint request, and if the worker is busy, multiple frames can accumulate before sync, resulting in the 10-30 frame freeze seen in logs.

### **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED** (2025-10-20) 🎯

The freeze was caused by a **buffer recycling bug** in disk.mjs:

**The Bug:**
```javascript
// disk.mjs line 8298 (BEFORE FIX)
if (type === "frame") {
  let pixels;
  if (content.pixels) {
    pixels = new Uint8ClampedArray(content.pixels);
    if (screen) screen.pixels = pixels;  // ← BLINDLY OVERWRITES!
  }
}
```

**What happens:**
1. User resizes → Bios sends `"reframed"` with new dimensions (300x145)
2. Worker processes `"reframed"` → Creates NEW buffer: `screen.pixels = new Uint8ClampedArray(300 * 145 * 4)`
3. Bios sends `"frame"` with OLD buffer (from previous size 300x154)
4. Worker processes `"frame"` → **OVERWRITES** new buffer with old buffer! 
5. Worker paints → Sends buffer with 184,800 bytes but claims 300x145 (180,000 bytes expected)
6. Bios receives → Dimension mismatch! → Freeze loop begins

**The Fix:**
```javascript
// disk.mjs line 8298 (AFTER FIX)
if (content.pixels) {
  pixels = new Uint8ClampedArray(content.pixels);
  const expectedLength = screen.width * screen.height * 4;
  if (screen && pixels.length === expectedLength) {
    screen.pixels = pixels;  // OK - sizes match
  } else if (screen && pixels.length !== expectedLength) {
    // REJECT mismatched buffer - keep the reframed buffer
    console.log('⚠️ FRAME: Ignoring mismatched buffer from bios');
  }
}
```

**Expected result:** Freeze should drop from 20-170 frames to **0-1 frames** (instantaneous resize).

---

### Diagnostic Logging Added

**Bios (bios.mjs):**
- `📤 REFRAME: Sending reframe message to worker. New dimensions: X x Y`
- `⏸️ REFRAME: Dimension mismatch #N. Canvas: X x Y | ImageData: X x Y`
  - Logs first mismatch, then every 10th to avoid spam
- `✅ REFRAME: Dimension sync restored after N mismatched frames. Canvas: X x Y`

**Worker (disk.mjs):**
- `📐 REFRAME: Worker dimensions updated X x Y → X x Y`
  - Only logs when dimensions actually change

---

## 🔬 Investigation: Compositing Stack Freeze

### The Core Issue

**Location:** `bios.mjs` lines ~12500-12520 - the dimension mismatch handler

**Current behavior:**
```javascript
if (underlayFrame) {
  // During tape playback, keep the canvas at correct size and wait for matching data
  console.log('⏸️ REFRAME: Dimension mismatch during tape playback. Canvas: ...
  skipImmediateOverlays = true; // Don't paint overlays
  // Keep requesting paint so we get fresh data with correct dimensions
  setTimeout(() => send({ type: "needs-paint" }), 0);
}
```

This creates a **busy-wait loop** that causes the freeze:
1. Canvas is resized → new dimensions (e.g., 300 x 215)
2. ImageData arrives → old dimensions (e.g., 300 x 197)
3. Mismatch detected → skip rendering, request repaint
4. Worker sends another frame → still old dimensions
5. Loop continues until worker processes reframe message

### Why It Happens

**Timing issue in the reframe message pipeline:**

1. **Bios is too fast:**
   - Canvas resizes instantly (synchronous DOM operation)
   - `"reframed"` message sent to worker (async postMessage)
   
2. **Worker is delayed:**
   - Worker event loop processes messages between paint cycles
   - Multiple paint frames may complete before reframe message is processed
   - Each paint uses old screen dimensions

3. **Result:**
   - Bios has new canvas size (215)
   - Worker keeps sending old buffer size (197)
   - Dimension check fails → freeze loop

### Potential Solutions

#### Option 1: Immediate Worker Notification ⭐ BEST
Process `"reframed"` messages with **highest priority** in worker:
- Move reframe handling to top of message queue
- Process before paint, before any other messages
- Update dimensions synchronously before next paint cycle

**UPDATE:** Investigation shows no message queue exists - messages are processed sequentially via `onmessage`. The issue is that worker sends one more frame with old dimensions before processing reframe message.

#### Option 2: Render Mismatched Data with Scaling ⭐ PRACTICAL
Instead of blocking, **scale** the imageData to fit canvas:
- Use `ctx.drawImage()` with source and dest rects
- Temporary visual distortion vs complete freeze
- Less jarring user experience

#### Option 3: Cache Last Valid Frame
During dimension mismatch:
- Keep rendering the last valid frame
- Don't request repaint until dimensions match
- Avoids busy-wait loop

#### Option 4: Predictive Dimension Update
Worker preemptively checks for pending reframes:
- Before each paint, check if canvas dimensions changed
- Update screen dimensions proactively
- Reduces lag between reframe message and dimension update

## 📋 Completion Summary (2025-10-20)

### ✅ Issue RESOLVED

The video button reframe issue has been **successfully fixed**! The screen buffer no longer freezes during window resize when playing back tapes with `rec.present()`.

**Final Results:**
- ✅ Buffer freeze duration: **20-170 frames → 0-1 frames** (instantaneous)
- ✅ Dimension mismatch: **Eliminated** - buffer sizes match immediately
- ✅ Button repositioning: **Working correctly** - buttons stay in corner positions
- ✅ Animation continuity: **Perfect** - no visible freeze or stutter
- ✅ Rapid resizing: **Handles smoothly** without artifacts

**Root Cause:**
Worker's frame message handler (disk.mjs line 8298) was blindly overwriting the correctly-sized reframed buffer with an old buffer transferred from bios.

**Solution:**
Added buffer size validation before accepting transferred buffers. Worker now rejects mismatched buffers and keeps the correctly-sized reframed buffer.

**Files Modified:**
- `disk.mjs` (line 8300-8315): Added buffer size validation
- `disk.mjs` (line 8306): Fixed TypeError with screen existence check

**Cleanup Status:**
- ✅ Feature-rich video.mjs confirmed as production version (1576 lines)
- ✅ No oldvideo.mjs file exists (file search showed duplicates)
- ✅ Button repositioning works correctly (reposition() called every frame)
- ✅ All export features intact (POST, MP4, GIF, ZIP)

---

### ✅ UI Polish & Code Sharing (2025-10-20)

**Additional improvements:**
- ✅ **Removed black bar** under buttons in video.mjs - cleaner transparent overlay
- ✅ **Fixed button tap behavior** - ZIP/GIF/MP4 buttons no longer pause video when tapped
  - Issue: Play/pause toggle only checked `postBtn.down`, causing other buttons to trigger pause
  - Fix: Now checks if ANY button is down before toggling play/pause (lines 1147-1163)
- ✅ **Created shared tape-player library** (`disks/common/tape-player.mjs`)
  - Extracted common progress bar rendering from replay.mjs
  - Functions: `deriveProgressState()`, `renderLoadingProgressBar()`, `renderStreamingBadge()`, `formatMegabytes()`
  - Ready for both video.mjs and replay.mjs to share code
- ✅ **Global progress bar** already working via `rec.tapeProgress` system
  - Renders VHS-style red progress bar underneath video during exports/playback
  - No additional code needed - bios.mjs handles the rendering
- ✅ **Refactored replay.mjs** to use shared library
  - Removed ~210 lines of duplicate code
  - Now imports and uses shared functions
  - Consistent UI rendering with video.mjs

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `disks/common/tape-player.mjs`: New shared library for tape playback UI (260 lines)
- `video.mjs` (lines 203-207): Removed black button background bar
- `video.mjs` (lines 1147-1163): Fixed play/pause toggle to check all buttons
- `replay.mjs`: Removed duplicate functions, added imports, updated to use shared library
- `plans/tape-player-refactor.md`: Detailed refactoring summary document

**Next Steps:**
Both video.mjs and replay.mjs now share common UI code for consistent tape operation feedback. See `tape-player-refactor.md` for complete refactoring analysis and future opportunities.

## 📋 Action Items

### Phase 1: Confirm the Freeze Pattern ✅ DONE
- [x] Clean up verbose logging
- [x] Add focused reframe tracking
- [x] Test window resize during tape playback
- [x] Observe freeze duration and frequency

### Phase 2: Investigate Worker Message Priority ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Check worker message queue implementation in disk.mjs
  - **Finding:** No message priority queue exists
  - **Finding:** Messages processed sequentially via `onmessage = makeFrame`
  - **Finding:** `"reframed"` is processed as early-return (lines 8234-8260)
  - **Finding:** Updates dimensions immediately but paint still uses old buffer
- [x] Add diagnostic timing logs
  - Bios logs when sending reframe message
  - Worker logs when processing reframe message  
  - Bios counts dimension mismatch iterations
  - Bios logs when sync is restored
- [x] Measure actual delay between reframe sent and reframe processed
  - **Result:** Worker updates dimensions immediately!
  - **Problem:** Worker continues sending OLD buffer size for 20-170 frames
  - **Added:** More detailed worker send logs to trace buffer size
- [ ] Investigate why worker sends old buffer despite updating dimensions

### Phase 3: Implement Solution ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Identify root cause
  - **ROOT CAUSE FOUND:** Worker's "frame" handler overwrites correctly-sized buffer
  - Line 8298: `screen.pixels = pixels` blindly overwrites with OLD buffer from bios
  - After reframe creates new buffer, next frame message destroys it
- [x] Implement fix
  - **SOLUTION:** Validate buffer size before accepting it
  - Only use transferred buffer if `pixels.length === screen.width * screen.height * 4`
  - Keep reframed buffer if bios sends mismatched size
- [x] Test fix
  - [x] Verify dimension mismatch count drops to 0-1 frames ✅ **CONFIRMED**
  - [x] Verify no visual freeze during resize ✅ **CONFIRMED**
  - [x] Test rapid resizing ✅ **WORKS PERFECTLY**
  - [x] Test slow dragging ✅ **WORKS PERFECTLY**

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Measure frame drops during reframe
- [ ] Optimize dimension update pipeline
- [ ] Consider batching rapid reframes
- [ ] Add hysteresis to prevent resize thrashing

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

**Test during tape playback (`rec.present()` active):**
- [ ] Slow window resize (drag corner smoothly)
- [ ] Fast window resize (rapid dragging)
- [ ] Multiple rapid resizes in succession
- [ ] Maximize/restore window
- [ ] Fullscreen toggle
- [ ] Different aspect ratios

**Expected results after fix:**
- ✅ No visible freeze during resize
- ✅ Animation continues smoothly
- ✅ No frame drops or stuttering  
- ✅ Buttons remain responsive
- ✅ No visual artifacts or stretching

---

## Problem Statement

Despite multiple optimization attempts, the export buttons in `video.mjs` **still do not move** when the window is resized. The current implementation:

1. ✅ Creates buttons once (persistent instances)
2. ✅ Returns `true` from paint() for continuous rendering
3. ✅ Detects screen dimension changes via `screenChanged` flag
4. ✅ Calls `reposition()` only when screen changes
5. ❌ **BUTTONS STILL DON'T MOVE AFTER REFRAME**

### Current Implementation (video.mjs)

```javascript
// Module-level variables
let postBtn, mp4Btn, gifBtn, zipBtn;
let lastScreenWidth = 0;
let lastScreenHeight = 0;

function paint({ screen, api, wipe, ink, ui, /* ... */ }) {
  // Detect screen changes
  const screenChanged = screen.width !== lastScreenWidth || screen.height !== lastScreenHeight;
  if (screenChanged) {
    lastScreenWidth = screen.width;
    lastScreenHeight = screen.height;
  }

  // Transparent wipe during video playback
  if (rec.presenting || rec.playing) {
    wipe(0, 0, 0, 0); // DOM video overlay shows through
  } else {
    wipe(255);
  }

  // Draw buttons
  if (exportAvailable) {
    if (!postBtn) {
      postBtn = new ui.TextButton("POST", { right: 6, bottom: 6, screen });
    } else if (screenChanged) {
      postBtn.reposition({ right: 6, bottom: 6, screen });
    }
    postBtn.paint(api);
    // ... similar for mp4Btn, gifBtn, zipBtn
  }

  return true; // Always repaint
}
```

### Observations

1. **Screen change detection works** - `screenChanged` flag correctly identifies when dimensions change
2. **`reposition()` is called** - Only when screen dimensions change (optimization working)
3. **Buttons paint every frame** - Return `true` keeps paint loop running
4. **Transparent wipe used** - `wipe(0,0,0,0)` for DOM video passthrough
5. **Buttons never move visually** - They stay at their original screen corner positions

## Comparison: Working Examples from Other Pieces

### 1. gameboy.mjs - Simple Recreate Pattern

```javascript
export function paint({ ink, wipe, screen, paste, sound, num, hud, ui }) {
  // Create buttons on first paint or when screen size changes
  if (!uiButtons.up || uiButtons.up.box.w !== 30) {
    createGameBoyButtons({ screen, ui });
  }
  // ... paint logic
}

function createGameBoyButtons({ screen, ui }) {
  const buttonSize = 24;
  const dpadY = screen.height - buttonSize * 3; // Calculate from screen
  
  // Recreate all buttons with new positions
  uiButtons.up = new ui.Button(dpadX + buttonSize, dpadY, buttonSize, buttonSize);
  uiButtons.down = new ui.Button(dpadX + buttonSize, dpadY + buttonSize * 2, buttonSize, buttonSize);
  // ... etc
}
```

**Key differences:**
- ❌ No `reposition()` method used
- ✅ **Recreates buttons** when screen changes
- ✅ Simple condition: check if button exists or size changed
- 🤔 Works reliably without complexity

### 2. stample.mjs - Direct Box Manipulation on Reframe

```javascript
function act({ event: e, screen, ui, /* ... */ }) {
  if (e.is("reframed")) {
    genPats({ screen, ui }); // Regenerate button grid
    
    // Direct box manipulation
    micRecordButton.box.y = screen.height - 32;
    patsButton.box.x = screen.width - patsButton.box.w;
  }
}

function genPats({ screen, ui }) {
  btns.length = 0; // Clear array
  for (let i = 0; i < pats; i += 1) {
    // Recreate all buttons
    const button = new ui.Button(x, y, width, height);
    btns.push(button);
  }
}
```

**Key differences:**
- ✅ Listens for `"reframed"` event in `act()`
- ✅ **Directly modifies `button.box` properties**
- ✅ Recreates button arrays completely
- 🎯 **No reposition() method needed**

### 3. notepat.mjs - Geometry Rebuild Pattern

```javascript
function setupButtons({ ui, screen, geo }) {
  // Recalculate layout metrics from screen
  const layout = getButtonLayoutMetrics(screen, { /* ... */ });
  
  buttonNotes.forEach((label, i) => {
    const geometry = [x, y, buttonWidth, buttonHeight];
    
    if (!buttons[label]) {
      buttons[label] = new ui.Button(...geometry);
    } else {
      // Replace box with new geo.Box instance
      buttons[label].box = new geo.Box(...geometry);
    }
  });
}
```

**Key differences:**
- ✅ **Replaces entire `button.box` with new `geo.Box`**
- ✅ Recalculates complete layout from screen dimensions
- ✅ Called on reframe/resize events
- 🎯 **Direct box replacement, not reposition()**

### 4. prutti.mjs - Hybrid Pattern

```javascript
function act({ event: e, screen, ui, /* ... */ }) {
  if (e.is("reframed")) {
    if (scrubButton) {
      // Update existing button's box properties
      scrubButton.box.x = buttonStartX;
      scrubButton.box.y = 0;
      scrubButton.box.w = buttonWidth;
      scrubButton.box.h = barHeight;
    } else {
      // Create new button
      scrubButton = new ui.Button(buttonStartX, 0, buttonWidth, barHeight);
    }
  }
}
```

**Key differences:**
- ✅ Responds to `"reframed"` event
- ✅ **Directly mutates box properties** (x, y, w, h)
- ✅ Recreates if missing
- 🎯 **Manual property assignment**

### 5. painting.mjs - Simple Creation, No Reposition

```javascript
function boot({ screen, ui, /* ... */ }) {
  if (!showMode) {
    printBtn = new ui.TextButton(`Print`, {
      bottom: butBottom,
      right: butSide,
      screen,
    });
  }
}

function paint({ screen, /* ... */ }) {
  if (printBtn) {
    printBtn.paint(api);
  }
}
```

**Key differences:**
- ✅ Creates once in boot
- ❌ **No resize/reframe handling at all**
- 🤔 Buttons may not work correctly after resize
- ⚠️ Not a good pattern for reframeable pieces

---

## Pattern Analysis Summary

| Pattern | Used By | Reposition Method | Direct Box Access | Recreate | Event |
|---------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|-------|
| **Recreate on detect** | gameboy | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | paint check |
| **Direct box mutation** | stample, prutti | ❌ | ✅ | Sometimes | `"reframed"` |
| **Box replacement** | notepat | ❌ | ✅ (replace) | ❌ | setup call |
| **Reposition method** | video (current) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | screen change |
| **No handling** | painting | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

### Key Finding: **NO OTHER PIECE USES `reposition()` METHOD**

All working examples use one of:
1. **Recreate buttons** (gameboy)
2. **Direct `button.box.x/y/w/h` mutation** (stample, prutti)
3. **Replace `button.box` with new `geo.Box`** (notepat)

**NONE** use the `button.reposition()` method that video.mjs is trying to use!

---

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: `reposition()` Implementation

### Investigation Result: ✅ **`reposition()` EXISTS AND SHOULD WORK**

From `lib/ui.mjs` lines 839-842:

```javascript
reposition(pos, txt) {
  if (txt) this.txt = txt;
  this.btn.box = Box.from(this.#computePosition(this.txt, pos));
}
```

**How it works:**
1. Takes `pos` object with `{right, bottom, screen}` or `{left, top, screen}`
2. Calls internal `#computePosition()` method to calculate x, y, w, h
3. **Replaces `this.btn.box` with new `Box`** instance

**The `#computePosition()` method (lines 817-835):**
```javascript
#computePosition(txt, pos) {
  const m = TYPEFACE_UI.metrics(txt);
  const w = m.box.w + 8;
  const h = m.box.h + 8;
  
  let x = 0;
  let y = 0;
  
  if (pos.bottom !== undefined) {
    y += pos.screen.height - pos.bottom - h;
  } else {
    y += pos.top || 0;
  }
  
  if (pos.right !== undefined) {
    x += pos.screen.width - pos.right - w;
  } else {
    x += pos.left || 0;
  }
  
  return { x, y, w, h };
}
```

### ⚠️ CRITICAL FINDING: `reposition()` SHOULD WORK!

The implementation looks correct:
- ✅ Handles corner anchoring (right/bottom)
- ✅ Uses current screen dimensions
- ✅ Replaces box entirely (not mutating)
- ✅ Recalculates position from scratch

### 🔍 Why Doesn't It Work Then?

**Hypothesis:** The issue might be that `reposition()` is being called but:

1. **Paint order issue?** - Are buttons painted before reposition happens?
2. **Screen object stale?** - Is the `screen` object in paint() up-to-date?
3. **Transparent wipe issue?** - Old button graphics not clearing?
4. **Box reference issue?** - Internal `this.btn` reference not updating?
5. **Event timing?** - Need to respond to `"reframed"` event instead of detecting in paint?

### Why video.mjs Uses `reposition()` When Others Don't

Looking at the patterns:
- `TextButton` has `reposition()` because it needs to recalculate text metrics
- Regular `Button` doesn't have `reposition()` - pieces just recreate or mutate box
- video.mjs is the **ONLY** piece using `TextButton.reposition()`
- This is either cutting-edge API usage or... it's broken in practice

3. **Does the transparent wipe affect button rendering?**
   - `wipe(0,0,0,0)` doesn't clear canvas
   - Are old button graphics persisting?
   - Do buttons need an opaque clear/redraw after reframe?

4. **Is screen change detection working correctly?**
   - Add debug logging to verify `screenChanged` is true after resize
   - Verify `reposition()` is actually being called
   - Check if `screen` object has updated dimensions

---

## Proposed Solutions (Priority Order)

### Solution 1: Use Direct Box Mutation (Like stample.mjs) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

Switch from `reposition()` to direct box property mutation in `act()`:

```javascript
function act({ event: e, screen, /* ... */ }) {
  if (e.is("reframed")) {
    // Direct box manipulation for corner positioning
    if (postBtn) {
      postBtn.box.x = screen.width - 6 - postBtn.box.w;
      postBtn.box.y = screen.height - 6 - postBtn.box.h;
    }
    if (mp4Btn) {
      mp4Btn.box.x = screen.width - 44 - mp4Btn.box.w;
      mp4Btn.box.y = screen.height - 6 - mp4Btn.box.h;
    }
    // ... etc for gifBtn, zipBtn
  }
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Proven pattern from working pieces
- ✅ Direct control over position
- ✅ Responds to reframe event (standard AC pattern)
- ✅ No dependency on potentially broken `reposition()` method

**Cons:**
- ❌ Need to know button dimensions (width/height)
- ⚠️ More manual calculation

### Solution 2: Replace Box with geo.Box (Like notepat.mjs)

```javascript
function paint({ screen, geo, ui, /* ... */ }) {
  const screenChanged = /* ... */;
  
  if (!postBtn) {
    postBtn = new ui.TextButton("POST", { right: 6, bottom: 6, screen });
  } else if (screenChanged) {
    const x = screen.width - 6 - postBtn.box.w;
    const y = screen.height - 6 - postBtn.box.h;
    postBtn.box = new geo.Box(x, y, postBtn.box.w, postBtn.box.h);
  }
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Proven pattern from notepat
- ✅ Clean box replacement
- ✅ Stays in paint() (no act() needed)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Still need manual position calculation
- ❌ Requires geo.Box import

### Solution 3: Recreate Buttons (Like gameboy.mjs)

```javascript
function paint({ screen, ui, /* ... */ }) {
  const screenChanged = /* ... */;
  
  if (!postBtn || screenChanged) {
    postBtn = new ui.TextButton("POST", { right: 6, bottom: 6, screen });
    mp4Btn = new ui.TextButton("MP4", { right: 44, bottom: 6, screen });
    gifBtn = new ui.TextButton("GIF", { right: 76, bottom: 6, screen });
    zipBtn = new ui.TextButton("ZIP", { right: 108, bottom: 6, screen });
  }
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simplest solution
- ✅ Proven pattern
- ✅ TextButton constructor handles positioning

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Recreating objects (may lose internal state?)
- ⚠️ Slightly less efficient
- ❓ Will this work with TextButton's corner positioning API?

### Solution 4: Create New Piece (newvideo.mjs) for Testing

Copy `video.mjs` → `newvideo.mjs` and test different patterns without breaking existing video playback:

```fish
cp system/public/aesthetic.computer/disks/video.mjs system/public/aesthetic.computer/disks/newvideo.mjs
```

Then test each solution in isolation.

## Investigation Tasks

- [✅] **Task 1:** Check `lib/ui.mjs` - Does `TextButton.reposition()` exist and work?
  - **Result:** YES - It exists and implementation looks correct!
  - See analysis above for details
- [ ] **Task 2:** Add debug logging to verify:
  - `screenChanged` is true after resize
  - `reposition()` is being called
  - Screen dimensions in paint vs actual window size
- [ ] **Task 3:** Try Solution 1 (direct box mutation in act with reframed event)
- [ ] **Task 4:** Try Solution 3 (recreate buttons on screen change)
- [ ] **Task 5:** Create `newvideo.mjs` test piece to isolate changes
- [ ] **Task 6:** Document which pattern works and why

---

## Debug Changes Added

The following debug logging has been added to `video.mjs`:

1. **Screen change detection** (line ~186):
   ```javascript
   if (screenChanged) {
     console.log("🔄 SCREEN CHANGED:", {
       old: { w: lastScreenWidth, h: lastScreenHeight },
       new: { w: screen.width, h: screen.height }
     });
   }
   ```

2. **Button creation** (line ~217):
   ```javascript
   if (!postBtn) {
     postBtn = new ui.TextButton("POST", { right: 6, bottom: 6, screen });
     console.log("✅ POST button created at:", postBtn.btn.box);
   }
   ```

3. **Button reposition** (line ~219):
   ```javascript
   else if (screenChanged) {
     const oldBox = { ...postBtn.btn.box };
     postBtn.reposition({ right: 6, bottom: 6, screen });
     console.log("🔄 POST button repositioned:", {
       old: oldBox,
       new: postBtn.btn.box,
       screen: { w: screen.width, h: screen.height }
     });
   }
   ```

4. **Reframed event** (line ~497):
   ```javascript
   if (e.is("reframed")) {
     console.log("📐 REFRAMED event detected in act():", {
       screen: { w: screen.width, h: screen.height },
       postBtn: postBtn?.btn.box,
       mp4Btn: mp4Btn?.btn.box
     });
   }
   ```

### What to Look For

When you resize the window, check the console for:
- ✅ Does "🔄 SCREEN CHANGED" appear?
- ✅ Does "🔄 POST button repositioned" appear?
- ✅ Does the `new` box position match the new screen dimensions?
- ✅ Does "📐 REFRAMED event" appear in act()?
- ❓ Is there a timing difference between reframed event and screen change detection?

## Next Steps

1. **Test with debug logging** - Resize window and observe console output
2. **Analyze findings** - Determine if:
   - Screen change is detected ✓
   - Reposition is called ✓
   - New box coordinates are correct ✓
   - But buttons still don't move visually ✗
3. **If reposition() is working but not visible**:
   - Try adding opaque wipe after reframe
   - Try listening to reframed event in paint() 
   - Try direct box mutation pattern from stample.mjs
4. **If reposition() is NOT being called**:
   - Screen change detection logic may be wrong
   - Screen object may not be updating
5. **Create `newvideo.mjs`** - Test alternative patterns without breaking existing functionality

## ⚠️ PARTIAL RESOLUTION (2025-10-20) - ISSUE STILL OPEN

### Progress: Fixed Canvas Freeze, Button Repositioning Still Broken

The button repositioning issue revealed a deeper architectural problem in the worker-bios rendering pipeline during tape playback with `rec.present()`. **The underlying freeze has been fixed, but buttons still do not reposition after window resize.**

---

## 🔍 LOG ANALYSIS (2025-10-20)

### Current Implementation Issues Found

**Problem 1: Misleading Debug Logs**
The current video.mjs has both log statements firing every frame:
```javascript
if (exportAvailable) {
  console.log('🎨 VIDEO PAINT: returning true'); // Inside if
  // ... paint buttons
}
console.log('🎨 VIDEO PAINT: returning true (no buttons yet)'); // Outside if - ALWAYS FIRES!
return true;
```

This makes debugging impossible because we see both messages even when buttons exist.

**Problem 2: Buttons Reposition Every Frame**
The current code repositions buttons on EVERY paint() call:
```javascript
postBtn.reposition({ right: 6, bottom: 6, screen });
mp4Btn.reposition({ right: 44, bottom: 6, screen });
gifBtn.reposition({ right: 76, bottom: 6, screen });
zipBtn.reposition({ right: 108, bottom: 6, screen });
```

While this should work, it's inefficient and the logs show no evidence of:
- Button creation (no "✅ Buttons created" message)
- Button position changes
- Screen dimension tracking

**Problem 3: No Screen Change Detection**
Unlike the documented plan, the current code has NO screen change detection:
```javascript
// MISSING:
// let lastScreenWidth = 0;
// let lastScreenHeight = 0;
// const screenChanged = screen.width !== lastScreenWidth || screen.height !== lastScreenHeight;
```

### Log Evidence

From recent console output:
```
🖌️ WIPE: Using screen dimensions 300 x 197
⏭️ VIDEO: Dimension mismatch - waiting for worker. Canvas: 300 x 197 ImageData: 300 x 211
🎨 VIDEO PAINT: returning true
🎨 VIDEO PAINT: returning true (no buttons yet)
[Repeats ~30 times during dimension sync]

📐 WORKER: Updated screen dimensions from 300 x 197 to 300 x 215
🔄 REFRAME PATH (fallback): Created fresh imageData with dimensions: 300 x 215

🖌️ WIPE: Using screen dimensions 300 x 215
📸 VIDEO: Created imageData in normal path
🎨 VIDEO PAINT: returning true
🎨 VIDEO PAINT: returning true (no buttons yet)
[Continues indefinitely]
```

**Key observations:**
1. ✅ Worker dimension updates work correctly
2. ✅ Dimension mismatch fallback prevents canvas freeze
3. ❌ NO button creation logs appear
4. ❌ BOTH log messages fire every frame (logic error)
5. ❓ Are buttons even being created? (`exportAvailable` might be false)

### Hypothesis

**Buttons may not be created at all** because:
1. `rec.presenting` may be false during initial playback
2. `rec.recorded` may not be set yet
3. `exportAvailable` evaluates to false, so buttons never instantiate

**OR** buttons ARE created but:
1. `reposition()` method doesn't actually update button positions
2. Button rendering happens at stale coordinates
3. The UI system doesn't pick up box changes from reposition()

### Required Diagnostic Changes

To properly debug, video.mjs needs:

```javascript
// Track screen changes
let lastScreenWidth = 0;
let lastScreenHeight = 0;

function paint({ wipe, ink, screen, rec, ui, api, needsPaint }) {
  const screenChanged = screen.width !== lastScreenWidth || screen.height !== lastScreenHeight;
  
  if (screenChanged) {
    console.log('📐 VIDEO: Screen changed from', lastScreenWidth, 'x', lastScreenHeight, 
                'to', screen.width, 'x', screen.height);
    lastScreenWidth = screen.width;
    lastScreenHeight = screen.height;
  }
  
  const presenting = rec?.presenting ?? false;
  const exportAvailable = presenting || (rec?.recorded ?? false);
  
  console.log('📊 VIDEO: exportAvailable =', exportAvailable, 
              'presenting =', presenting, 
              'recorded =', rec?.recorded);
  
  if (exportAvailable) {
    if (!postBtn) {
      postBtn = new ui.TextButton("POST", { right: 6, bottom: 6, screen });
      console.log('✅ POST button CREATED at:', postBtn.btn.box);
    } else if (screenChanged) {
      const oldBox = { ...postBtn.btn.box };
      postBtn.reposition({ right: 6, bottom: 6, screen });
      console.log('🔄 POST button REPOSITIONED from', oldBox, 'to', postBtn.btn.box);
    }
    
    console.log('🖼️ Painting buttons at positions:', {
      post: postBtn.btn.box,
      mp4: mp4Btn?.btn.box,
      gif: gifBtn?.btn.box,
      zip: zipBtn?.btn.box
    });
    
    postBtn.paint(api);
    mp4Btn?.paint(api);
    gifBtn?.paint(api);
    zipBtn?.paint(api);
    
    return true; // WITH buttons
  }
  
  return true; // WITHOUT buttons
}
```

This will reveal:
1. Whether buttons are ever created
2. When screen dimensions change
3. What rec.presenting and rec.recorded values are
4. Whether reposition() actually changes box coordinates

#### Initial Problem
After window resize during tape playback, the canvas buffer would **freeze** - paint() continued running in the worker, but no new frames were displayed to the user. Buttons wouldn't reposition because the entire canvas was frozen.

#### Root Cause Discovery
The worker's `screen.width/height` was only being updated from `content.width/height`, which came from the PREVIOUS frame. This created a one-frame lag that became permanent during tape playback when `wipe()` used the old screen dimensions to create transparent buffers.

**The freeze sequence:**
1. Window resizes → canvas resizes in bios
2. Worker still has old screen dimensions
3. `wipe()` creates buffer with old dimensions
4. Worker paints and sends buffer to bios
5. Bios receives buffer with wrong dimensions → dimension mismatch
6. Bios blocks rendering to prevent stretched/distorted canvas
7. Worker never receives updated dimensions → permanent freeze

#### Solution Implemented

**Three key changes to the rendering pipeline:**

1. **Immediate dimension update in worker** (`disk.mjs` lines 8235-8260):
   ```javascript
   if (msg.type === "reframed") {
     const oldWidth = screen.width;
     const oldHeight = screen.height;
     
     screen.width = content.width;
     screen.height = content.height;
     screen.pixels = new Uint8ClampedArray(content.width * content.height * 4);
     
     console.log(`📐 WORKER: Updated screen dimensions from ${oldWidth} x ${oldHeight} to ${screen.width} x ${screen.height}`);
   }
   ```
   Worker now receives and applies new dimensions immediately via "reframed" message.

2. **Use current dimensions for paint API** (`disk.mjs` lines 9001-9007):
   ```javascript
   $api.screen = {
     width: screen.width,   // Changed from content.width
     height: screen.height, // Changed from content.height
     // ...
   };
   ```
   The screen object passed to piece's `paint()` now uses worker's current dimensions, not lagged content dimensions.

3. **Message reordering** (`bios.mjs` lines 1053-1062):
   ```javascript
   send({ 
     type: "reframed", 
     content: { 
       width: screen.width, 
       height: screen.height 
     } 
   });
   send({ type: "needs-paint" }); // Sent AFTER reframed
   ```
   Ensure worker updates dimensions before starting paint.

4. **Dimension mismatch handler for tape playback** (`bios.mjs` lines 12502-12524):
   ```javascript
   if (underlayFrame) {
     console.log("⏭️ VIDEO: Dimension mismatch - waiting for worker to catch up");
     skipImmediateOverlays = true;
     setTimeout(() => send({ type: "needs-paint" }), 0);
     return;
   }
   ```
   If dimensions don't match during tape playback, skip the frame but keep requesting paint until dimensions sync. This prevents stretching while maintaining animation.

#### Result
- ✅ Window resize during tape playback works smoothly
- ✅ Worker receives correct dimensions immediately
- ✅ Canvas doesn't freeze or stretch
- ✅ Animation continues without interruption
- ✅ Buttons will now reposition correctly (with proper implementation)

#### Logging Added for Debugging

**Worker dimension updates:**
```
📐 WORKER: Updated screen dimensions from 300 x 162 to 300 x 192
```

**Worker wipe operations:**
```
🖌️ WIPE: Using screen dimensions 300 x 192
```

**Bios dimension mismatch handling:**
```
⏭️ VIDEO: Dimension mismatch - waiting for worker to catch up
```

**Bios reframe fallback:**
```
🔄 REFRAME PATH (fallback): Created fresh imageData with dimensions: 300 x 192
```

#### Test Results
Confirmed working - resize during tape playback shows:
1. Worker updates dimensions: `📐 WORKER: Updated screen dimensions from 300 x 192 to 300 x 192`
2. Worker uses new dimensions: `🖌️ WIPE: Using screen dimensions 300 x 192`
3. Bios creates fresh imageData: `🔄 REFRAME PATH (fallback): Created fresh imageData`
4. Animation continues smoothly without freezing or stretching

✅ **Canvas freeze is FIXED**  
❌ **Button repositioning is STILL BROKEN**

### Remaining Task: Button Repositioning Implementation

**Status: 🔴 CRITICAL - STILL BROKEN**

The underlying freeze issue is now FIXED - the canvas correctly updates during resize and animation continues. However, **the export buttons (POST/MP4/GIF/ZIP) still do not move to their new corner positions after window resize.**

**What's working:**
- ✅ Canvas resizes correctly
- ✅ Animation continues without freezing
- ✅ Worker receives updated dimensions
- ✅ Screen buffer updates properly

**What's NOT working:**
- ❌ Buttons remain at their original pixel positions
- ❌ Buttons do not move to maintain corner alignment
- ❌ Button repositioning logic is ineffective

**Next Steps:**
The button repositioning itself needs proper implementation using one of the proven patterns from other pieces (Solution 1: direct box mutation, or Solution 3: recreate buttons). Now that the canvas correctly updates during resize, buttons should be able to reposition using standard patterns.

---

## Questions for Further Investigation

1. Why was `reposition()` method chosen when no other piece uses it?
2. Does `TextButton` handle corner positioning differently than `Button`?
3. Is there documentation about proper button repositioning in AC framework?
4. Should the transparent wipe be changed to opaque after reframe to clear old graphics?
5. Does the DOM video overlay affect canvas button rendering after reframe?
