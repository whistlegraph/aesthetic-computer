// Continuous Evolution Suck Function - Living Physics System

Here's what the new continuously-evolving suck function does:

## ÔøΩ **Continuous Evolution** (No More Terminal State!)
- **No static snapshots** - each call builds on the previous result
- **Living system** where pixels truly flow from inside to outside continuously  
- **Lower threshold (0.1)** for more frequent, incremental transformations
- **Compounds over time** like a real fluid dynamics simulation

## üîÑ **True Flow Circulation**
- **Inside pixels gradually move outside** over multiple suck calls
- **Outside pixels flow inward** to replace them
- **Continuous circulation** creates perpetual motion
- **No terminal state** - keeps evolving as long as you apply force

## ‚ö° **Incremental Physics**
- **Small force applications** build up over time
- **Logarithmic falloff**: `force = strength * log(distance + 1) / (distance + 1)`
- **Smooth incremental displacement** instead of large jumps
- **Natural physics evolution** that feels organic and alive

## üåÄ **Seamless Wrapping**
- **Distance-preserved wrapping** when pixels cross boundaries
- **Smooth emergence** from opposite edges
- **No harsh transitions** or sudden jumps
- **Continuous spatial flow** with proper boundary conditions

## ÔøΩ **Enhanced Control**
- `(suck 0.05)` - Very gentle continuous evolution
- `(suck 0.2)` - Moderate flowing motion  
- `(suck -0.1)` - Gentle outward expansion
- `(suck 1)` - Strong inward pull for dramatic effects

## üß¨ **Living System Properties**
- **State persistence** - each call modifies the living buffer
- **Evolutionary behavior** - patterns emerge and evolve over time
- **Non-terminal** - no static end state, always dynamic
- **Organic emergence** - complex patterns from simple physics

## üé® **Creative Possibilities**
- `(s0.1 (suck 0.1))` - Gentle perpetual vortex that never stops
- Combine with drawing for **dynamic pattern emergence**
- **Temporal art** where the piece continues evolving
- **Living textures** that flow and circulate continuously

Try: `(s0.05 (suck 0.08))` for a gentle, ever-evolving vortex that never reaches a terminal state! ÔøΩÔ∏èüí´
