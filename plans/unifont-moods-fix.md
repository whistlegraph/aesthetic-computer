# Unifont Moods Fix - Progress Report

## Problem
The unifont typeface in `moods.mjs` is rendering with multicolored/weird appearance after recent text rendering changes. Need to update unifont pipeline to be in parity with chunky8 and font_1.

## Current State Analysis

### Files Involved
1. `/workspaces/aesthetic-computer/system/public/aesthetic.computer/disks/moods.mjs` - Uses unifont on lines 367 and 381
2. `/workspaces/aesthetic-computer/system/public/aesthetic.computer/lib/disk.mjs` - Main text rendering pipeline

### Key Findings

#### Unifont Usage in Moods
- Line 367: `text.box(mood, undefined, undefined, scale, "unifont").box.width;`
- Line 381: `api.ink(moodColor).write(mood, { x: textX, y: 2, size: scale }, undefined, undefined, false, "unifont");`

#### Text Rendering Pipeline (disk.mjs)
The main pipeline has special handling for certain fonts:

```javascript
// Line 192-196: ensureTypefaceLoaded function
function ensureTypefaceLoaded(typeface) {
  if (!typeface || typeof typeface.load !== "function") return;
  const requiresLoad =
    typeface.data?.bdfFont ||
    typeface.name === "unifont" ||
    typeface.name === "MatrixChunky8";
```

**Key observation:** Unifont is treated as a font that requires loading (like MatrixChunky8)

#### Color Preservation Logic
Lines 425, 441+ in disk.mjs show special color handling:
```javascript
const shouldPreserveColors = preserveColors || (typefaceName === "MatrixChunky8" && containsColorCodes);
```

**Issue identified:** MatrixChunky8 has special color preservation logic that unifont doesn't have!

#### MatrixChunky8 vs Unifont
- MatrixChunky8: Extensive color code handling, preserveColors flag support
- Unifont: Listed in `ensureTypefaceLoaded` but missing color handling logic
- Both are BDF fonts that require async loading

## Root Cause
Unifont is being treated as a "special" font (requires loading) but doesn't have the same color preservation and rendering logic as MatrixChunky8. The recent text changes likely added color code processing that's affecting unifont incorrectly.

## Solution Approach

### Option 1: Add Unifont to Color Preservation Logic
Update the `shouldPreserveColors` check to include unifont:
```javascript
const shouldPreserveColors = preserveColors || 
  ((typefaceName === "MatrixChunky8" || typefaceName === "unifont") && containsColorCodes);
```

### Option 2: Treat Unifont Like MatrixChunky8 Throughout Pipeline
Add unifont checks wherever MatrixChunky8 is specially handled in the text rendering pipeline.

### Option 3: Force Simple Rendering for Moods
Since moods.mjs explicitly passes `false` for the preserveColors parameter (line 381), ensure unifont respects this flag.

## Next Steps

1. **Search for all color code handling logic** in disk.mjs where MatrixChunky8 is mentioned
2. **Determine if unifont should:**
   - Always disable color codes (simple monochrome)
   - Support color codes like MatrixChunky8
   - Be treated differently based on context
3. **Update rendering functions** to handle unifont consistently
4. **Test in moods.mjs** to verify fix

## Files to Edit
- `/workspaces/aesthetic-computer/system/public/aesthetic.computer/lib/disk.mjs` - Add unifont handling
- Possibly `/workspaces/aesthetic-computer/system/public/aesthetic.computer/disks/moods.mjs` - Verify usage

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Implementation complete.

## Changes Made

### 1. Color Preservation Fix (`disk.mjs`)
Updated color preservation and shadow logic to treat unifont like MatrixChunky8:
- Line 425: Added unifont to `shouldPreserveColors` check
- Line 441: Added unifont to shadow rendering check  
- Line 3928: Added unifont to diagnostic logging check

### 2. Font Width Stability Fix (`type.mjs`)
**Fixed erratic marquee by forcing consistent 8px width:**
- Line 564-569: Added early return in `getAdvance()` to force unifont to always return 8px
- Prevents width from changing when glyphs load asynchronously
- Bypasses advance cache entirely for unifont

### 3. Subpixel Rendering Fix (`moods.mjs`)
**Fixed flickering by rounding positions to whole pixels:**
- Line 338: Round y position with `Math.floor(y)` 
- Line 387: Round textX position with `Math.floor(-osc * bounceAmount)`
- Prevents subpixel rendering that causes jittery appearance with pixel fonts

### 4. Text Cleanup and Marquee Improvements (`moods.mjs`)
**Better text handling and animation:**
- Line 341-344: Improved newline/whitespace cleaning with regex
- Line 386-387: Always apply subtle bounce (4px minimum) even for short text
- Makes short moods more visually interesting

### 5. Font Metadata (`fonts.mjs`)
- Kept `proportional: false` for unifont
- `glyphWidth: 8` used as the fixed width

## Known Issue: Question Mark Glyph
Question marks may not display with unifont glyph initially because:
- Unifont glyphs load asynchronously via BDF API
- Early return in `getAdvance()` bypasses glyph loading check
- May fall back to default font_1 until glyph loads
- **Potential fix**: Preload common punctuation glyphs or ensure unifont glyph loading still works

## Root Cause Summary
1. **Color artifacts**: Unifont wasn't in the color code stripping logic
2. **Erratic marquee**: Async glyph loading changed width calculations mid-animation
3. **Flickering**: Fractional pixel positions (0.25px increments) caused subpixel rendering jitter
4. **Solution**: Force 8px width + round all positions to whole pixels

## Testing
Test in moods by running the piece and verifying:
- ✓ Text renders in solid colors (no multicolor artifacts)
- ✓ Horizontal scrolling/marquee is smooth (no jank)
- ✓ Character spacing is correct at 8px per character
- ✓ Text measurements match actual rendering
