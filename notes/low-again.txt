*** low ðŸ˜¢ again ***  (loop)

TODO: - how can i work out the notes of this song using
        an a.c instrument?
      - and then put the lyrics in a sing-a-long piece

ðŸ‘‹ hello, my friend
do you see me do you need me
feeling low again 
just a chemical reaction in my head
trust it

really no-one is around
to tell about
all of it

and i wake up every morning
messages unread

that's a currency of care today
so please open them

and simply call me when ur free
to say âž°
