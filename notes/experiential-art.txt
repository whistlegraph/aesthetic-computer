1. What does the term “experiential art” mean to you? How would you define it?

Putting a label on any kind of art is a sign that one wants to do something to
or with, or for art, rather than create art. When I was in grad school at Yale
my classmate came up with a pejorative term for the painting department and
calling it "painting arts". We would joke about going to sit in on some
"painting arts" critiques or go hang out in the "painting arts" building. I
really liked this joke because it simultaneously pointed to this linguistic
ick while also devaluing the economic heirarchy of the art world, where painting
is king.

In this case the label "experiential" is being applied in wild's marketing
to embrace and support the new economy of interactive, software based art and
utilitous digital asset creation to make spatial social media software for the
next generation of hardware. And Wild is not alone in this race to explore
spatial media.

2. Do you think that experiential art is important? Why?

The social and creative energy this term points to could be orchestrated to exist in a shared
environment with a shared mission and love for art. Everyone could benefit in this way.

We may continue to call networked spatial environments "webs" but we won't be
calling them "pages" or "games" or even "apps". I am interested in what that
term is going to be. What is the actual media going to be? "Experiential art" is
a rallying term both useful and transient. I wanna know what terms will stick to
media forever. "GIF" sticks, "disk" sticks, and "App" sticks.

3. We believe that the future of the internet is spatial. What do you think?
   Does this mean anything to you?

4. What do you want to see develop in the space?
   (Space meaning the wider digital arts ecosystem)

5. What/who, in the field of experiential art, inspires you the most?
