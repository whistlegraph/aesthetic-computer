Aesthetic Computer is a mobile-first runtime and social network for creative computing.

AC's client interface is designed to function like a musical instrument, on which users discover their own memorizable paths in the network of commands and published pieces. As users grow their literacy through play and exploration, they are able to improvise, recombine, and expand their performable repertoire.

I started writing Aesthetic Computer in 2021 because I desired new tools to author, publish and connect the creative software toys I had been making in my art and education practice for 10+ years. The last of these before AC was https://nopaint.art, discussed on Hacker News in 2020.[0]

### Try Me

Visit https://aesthetic.computer and press the top left of the screen or type any key to activate the prompt.

In the AC prompt, enter names of built-in toy and utility pieces like `notepat`[1], or `boyfriend` and those published by user handles like `@bash/hub`.

Return to the prompt by pressing the name at the top left corner, your browser's back button or the `[Esc]`, ``[`]``, or `[Backspace]` keyboard shortcuts.

Enter `list` at the prompt for a scrollable index of pieces and commands.

Most of AC is open to anonymous users. Some pieces like `chat` or `moods` require a registered @handle to fully participate and post data.

Every piece on AC is URL addressable. For example, users who enjoy using `notepat` can skip the prompt entirely by bookmarking https://aesthetic.computer/notepat.

QR codes to share any piece can be generated by prefixing the piece with `share` at prompt as in `share notepat`.

Here are a some recipes to try:

### A. Make a Painting üñºÔ∏è

1. Enter `new 128` to start a new 128x128 pixel painting.
2. Enter `rect red` and drag to paint red (or any CSS color) rectangles.<br>
   (Or try other primitive brushes like `line`, `shape`, and `fill`.)
3. Press the command name in the top left corner to return to `prompt`.<br>
   (Or use `[Esc]`, `[Backspace]`, or ``[`]`` on the keyboard.)
5. Enter `smear` and drag to use a pixel scattering brush, then return to `prompt`.
6. Enter `dl` to download a timestamped PNG, `done` to publish the painting on AC servers, or `print` to mail order a real sticker.

### B. Play a Melody üéπ

1. Enter `+` to open a second prompt window.
2. Enter `metronome 120` in the second prompt window to keep rhythm at 120 BPM.
3. Enter `notepat` in the first prompt window to play tones in regular time.<br>
   (Or try `bleep:sine 4x4` for a randomized playable tone matrix.)<br><br>
**Bonus**
4. Record a `notepat` performance as a 7s looping, downloadable video by entering `tape notepat`.
5. Play `notepat` in person with others by generating a QR code via `share notepat`.

### C. Say "hi" in `chat` üó®Ô∏è

1. Enter `imnew` or press [I'm New] on a deactivated prompt to register.
2. Verify your email.
3. Set a @handle by entering `handle ur-handle-here`.
4. First-time handle setters are automatically routed to `chat`.
5. Say "hi" and request technical help from myself (@jeffrey) and others.

To dive in more you can read the technical history [2] or try coding your own AC
piece[3].

### KidLisp

Aesthetic Computer includes KidLisp, a minimal Lisp dialect for creating generative art and interactive experiences. See the [KidLisp documentation](kidlisp/) for language reference, examples, and technical details.

### ATProto Experiments (`/at`)

The `/at` directory contains experimental tools for exploring ATProto (Authenticated Transfer Protocol) and Bluesky integration.

**Tools available:**

- üîç **`query-profile.mjs`** - Query profile info for any ATProto handle or DID
- üìù **`query-posts.mjs`** - Fetch and display posts from any account
- üì§ **`post-to-bluesky.mjs`** - Post to @aesthetic.computer Bluesky account
- üìã **`explore-lexicons.mjs`** - Browse Bluesky and proposed AC lexicons
- üîê **`resolve-did.mjs`** - Resolve DIDs and inspect PDS configurations
- üß™ **`test-all.mjs`** - Verify all tools are working

**Quick start:**
```bash
cd at
npm install
node query-profile.mjs aesthetic.computer
node explore-lexicons.mjs
```

**Current state:** @aesthetic.computer exists on Bluesky with DID `did:plc:k3k3wknzkcnekbnyde4dbatz`

**Future plans:** See [ATProto PDS Roadmap](plans/atproto-pds-roadmap.md) for full strategy including:
- Running AC's own Personal Data Server (PDS)
- Per-user ATProto identities (`user.aesthetic.computer`)
- Custom lexicons for paintings, pieces, and KidLisp
- Federation with Bluesky network

See [`/at/README.md`](at/README.md) and [`/at/QUICKSTART.md`](at/QUICKSTART.md) for full documentation.
