**VM Setup:**
- ‚úÖ GCP VM created (n2-standard-8: 8 vCPU, 32GB RAM, 300GB SSD)
- ‚úÖ Bootstrap script completed
  - ‚úÖ Chocolatey installed
  - ‚úÖ Git for Windows installed

**Perforce Integration:**

- ‚è≥ **Waiting for "machine" user credentials to propagate** 
  - User just created in false.work's Helix Core Cloud
  - Need to verify password and access permissions
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Workspace creation pending (after login works)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Project sync pending (30-60 min download after workspace created)

**Next Steps:**
1. Verify Perforce "machine" user login works
2. Create Perforce workspace pointing to //depot/SpiderLily/SL_main
3. Sync Spider Lily project (~50-100GB)
4. Configure GitHub Actions runner
5. Test first build
6. Document build workflow

**Timeline Estimate:**
- UE5 install: ~1-2 hours remaining
- Perforce sync: ~30-60 minutes (after credentials verified)
- First build test: ~30-60 minutes
- Total: ~3-5 hours to fully operational
