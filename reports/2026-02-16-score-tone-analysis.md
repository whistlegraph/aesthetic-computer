# On the Voice of SCORE.md

*A prosaic analysis*

## The Tension

SCORE.md wants to be a score — a musical notation, a Fluxus instruction, a field of possibility. The title gestures toward this. "Score for Computer." Like Yoko Ono's *Grapefruit* or La Monte Young's word pieces. An invitation to perform, not a manual to follow.

But the document speaks in imperatives. In absolutes. In bold text and capital letters:

- "This applies to ALL agents"
- "Not 70%. Not 'probably.' **98%.**"
- "NEVER touch files outside the scope of your task"
- Sacred Ground (Off-Limits)
- The Rules

It reads like a handbook. Like something from a company that fears liability, or a military that needs compliance. The language wants control. It wants guarantee. It wants to prevent the wrong thing from happening.

This is understandable. Code breaks. Systems fail. The impulse to prescribe, to fence off danger zones, to give precise percentages (98%!) — this comes from care. From wanting the garden to flourish without being trampled.

But a score trusts the performer.

---

## What a Score Does

Consider John Cage's *4'33"*:

```
TACET
```

Or Yoko Ono's painting instruction:

```
Hammer a nail into a mirror, a piece of glass,
a canvas, wood or metal every morning.
```

Or Alison Knowles' *Proposition #2*:

```
Make a salad.
```

These are not prescriptive. They are invitations. They create a space, a gesture, a possibility. The performer brings their own understanding. The work emerges from that trust.

The instructions don't say:
- "NEVER use a spoon instead of a hammer"
- "You must be 98% certain the nail will hold"
- "Sacred Ground: Do not hammer into the curator's mirror"

The score assumes intelligence. Assumes care. Assumes the performer knows what a nail is, what hammering means, what morning feels like.

## Whistlegraph's Language

Whistlegraph's pieces — aesthetic.computer itself — speak in minimal gestures:

```
wander
paint
type
prompt
```

These are verbs without objects. Possibilities without prescriptions. The system invites. It doesn't command.

The gap between how AC speaks to its users and how SCORE.md speaks to its contributors is noticeable.

---

## Where the Prescription Lives

**Line 65:**
"This applies to ALL agents working on Aesthetic Computer — human, AI, ant, or otherwise."

The ALL is anxious. It wants to be heard. It's afraid of being ignored.

**Lines 74-78:**
```
Signal means:
- You understand the problem
- You see the fix
- You are 98% sure it is correct

Not 70%. Not "probably." 98%.
```

The repetition, the emphasis, the precision of the number — this is trying to prevent something. But what is it preventing? An agent making a 70% confident change? That would be caught by tests. The system has verification built in. The score doesn't need to yell.

**Lines 304-312:**
```
Sacred Ground (Off-Limits)

Do not modify these without explicit queen approval:
- Core runtime
- Database/auth/payment code
...
```

The language of "sacred" mixed with "off-limits" and "explicit approval" — there's a conceptual confusion here. Sacred things aren't enforced by authority. They're understood through respect. The Louvre doesn't need a sign saying "NEVER touch the Mona Lisa." The sacredness is felt.

**Lines 316-325:**
Ten numbered rules. Each one an imperative. Several in caps. This is a checklist, a protocol, a procedure manual.

Compare to the elegance at line 67:

```
You wander until you find a path.
```

This is perfect. This is a score. The rest is commentary that doesn't trust the simplicity.

---

## A Possible Direction

What if SCORE.md trusted its performers the way AC trusts its users?

What if instead of:
```
NEVER make speculative changes. 98% confidence or walk away.
```

It said:
```
When the path is clear, walk it.
When it's not, wander.
```

What if "Sacred Ground (Off-Limits)" became:
```
Core runtime, auth, payments — these are load-bearing walls.
```

No need to say "do not modify." The metaphor carries the weight. An agent that understands "load-bearing" knows what that means. An agent that doesn't understand wouldn't be helped by "off-limits" either.

What if the ten Colony Rules became:
```
Find signal.
Make the smallest change.
Verify.
Commit.
```

The rest is implied. An agent sophisticated enough to work on this codebase knows what "verify" means. Knows that tests should pass. Knows that wandering without finding signal is valid.

---

## The Philosophy Already There

The beautiful parts of SCORE.md are already present:

**Line 67-69:**
```
You wander until you find a path.

A path is a change you could make to this codebase.
Paths are everywhere. Most are noise.
You are looking for signal.
```

**Line 105:**
```
Wandering is not failure. Wandering is the job.
```

**Line 106:**
```
The colony does not need you to be busy.
It needs you to be right.
```

These are score-like. Evocative. Trusting. They invite understanding rather than demanding compliance.

The work, perhaps, is to let the rest of the document match the tone that's already here in these moments.

## On Trust

The corporate handbook says: "Do not do X, Y, or Z."

The artistic score says: "Here is the gesture. You understand."

Aesthetic Computer is an instrument. SCORE.md could be the sheet music. Not the owner's manual.

An instrument trusts the player to not break it. Not because there's a warning label, but because the player understands what an instrument is. Respects what it does. Knows how to listen.

The ants, the agents, the contributors — they arrive with intelligence. With care. With some understanding of what code is, what systems are, what collaboration means.

The score can trust that.

---

## Notation vs. Instruction

At line 270, there's a gesture toward this:

```
Notation:
- compush — commit, push
```

This is perfect. Minimal. Not prescriptive. Just: here's the notation. You understand.

What if more of SCORE.md spoke like this?

Not "When working with Claude Code on this repository, these shorthand commands are recognized and you must use them as follows..."

Just: `compush — commit, push`

The agent gets it. Or doesn't, and will ask.

---

## Closing

SCORE.md contains within it both impulses:
- The score (evocative, trusting, minimal)
- The handbook (prescriptive, anxious, detailed)

The question isn't whether rules exist. They do. Tests must pass. Core systems need care. Some things are dangerous to touch.

The question is: what voice communicates that?

The voice that trusts its performers, or the voice that fears their mistakes?

Whistlegraph's work — AC itself, the pieces, the language, the aesthetic — speaks in the first voice.

Perhaps the score could too.
