## Radical Digital Painting

*Radical Digital Painting* (RDP) is a framework Scudder has articulated since 2017 through a manifesto, 65+ lecture performances, and exhibitions across three continents.

## Whistlegraph

### Invention & Concept

The whistlegraph was **invented by Jeffrey Alan Scudder in 2019**, with early world-building and developmental support from Ella Fleck and Alex Freundlich. A whistlegraph is a hybrid artwork combining drawing, singing, and poetry into a single reproducible score: each line in the image corresponds to a sung line, performed identically each time.

Sources: [Whistlegraph Wiki (Concept)](https://whistlegraph.fandom.com/wiki/Whistlegraph_(Concept)), [Whistlegraph Wiki (Trio)](https://whistlegraph.fandom.com/wiki/The_Whistlegraph_trio), [Schneider Museum of Art](https://sma.sou.edu/whistlegraph/)

### The Whistlegraph Trio (2020–2023)

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Scudder formed a performance trio with Alex Freundlich and Camille Klein in a cabin in Ashland, Oregon. They began posting videos on TikTok, building a following through musical drawing tutorials and comedy-horror lecture-performances.

The trio was commissioned by [Rhizome](https://rhizome.org/events/the-longest-whistlegraph/) to perform *The Longest Whistlegraph Ever (so far)* at the **New Museum**, NYC (2022), and exhibited [*Ten Whistlegraphs*](https://feralfile.com/exhibitions/ten-whistlegraphs-thv) on Feral File (2022).

The trio separated in November 2023. Scudder continues the Whistlegraph practice as a solo artist with full control of all social media accounts.

## The Jeffrey Heart Era (2007–2011)

"Jeffrey Heart" was a **performance art identity** used by Scudder primarily during his time at Ringling College and the New York Studio Program (NYSP) residency. The persona had its own email address (jeffreyheart@gmail.com) and was ceremonially created and destroyed through two documented performances.

The [Rhizome Artist Profile](https://rhizome.org/editorial/2017/dec/05/Artist-Profile-Jeffrey-Alan-Scudder/) is titled "Jeffrey Alan Scudder (Jeffrey Heart)", confirming this as a publicly known alias.

### Key Works (from [bin-sc.jas.life](https://bin-sc.jas.life))

| Project | Description |
|---|---|
| **Birth and Death of Jeffrey Heart** | Two performance videos: `birth-of-Jeffrey-Heart.mov` (2008) and `death-of-Jeffrey-Heart.mov` (2010) |
| **Jeffrey Heart** | 190 photographs |
| **Early Heart Works** | 107 drawings from first months at Ringling |
| **THE HISTORY OF HEART** | A book made from an art history textbook |
| **HEART ATTACK** | A small book of drawings given away (20 pages) |
| **LOVE HEART EVERYTHING** | A dorm room band with Tom — 8 audio tracks, live performances |
| **Jeffrey's Girlfriend** | 73 greyscale portrait drawings |
| **awesome good day jeffrey heart** | 59 notebook pages from the NYSP residency in NYC |
| **JAS Obsession** | Includes `JAS-Jeffrey_Heart_retrospectre.mov` (2.2GB retrospective) |

### Writing & Literary Context

The archive contains significant literary/writing content adjacent to the **alt-lit movement** of the late 2000s:

- **Diary entries** (2010–2012): Confessional, observational prose in a style adjacent to alt-lit. Example: *"today / in painting class / i talked too much..."*
- **62 notes** (2011–2013): Stream-of-consciousness text files referencing Allen Ginsberg, Blake Butler, James Franco — including a riff on "Howl"
- **Various and extraneous documents**: `a-few-poems.pdf`, `summer-diary-09.pdf`, `self-interview-09.pdf`
- **Correspondences**: 612 encrypted PDFs of emails/chats from jeffreyheart@gmail.com (October 2010). Subject lines include "DOO DOO DOO DOO DOOOM PATROL", "EXTREME IMAGE CONTROL", "Wound licking is no spectator sport"
- **Fantasy** project (NYSP): Contains `20.Tao.png` — likely a portrait of Tao Lin, placing Scudder in the same NYC scene

### Influences in Collection

The archive's `/Collection/Text/` includes Frank O'Hara's *"Why I Am Not a Painter"* and Ted Nelson's *Computer Lib / Dream Machines* — bridging the New York School poetry tradition with early computer culture.

## Competitive Gaming Background (Verified)

Scudder competed in Unreal Tournament 2004 at the **World Cyber Games 2004** USA qualifiers under the handle "verdeo" (also known as "skooder"). He won the New Jersey regional qualifier and competed at the USA National Finals at GameWorks, Long Beach, CA (September 17–19, 2004).

**Verification**: 20 photographs from the event are preserved in Scudder's Dropbox (`/WCG 2004 Nationals/`). Photos show:
- Competitors at desktop PCs with CRT monitors and headsets in a tournament setup
- Social scenes at the arcade venue
- The **awards ceremony on stage with Samsung WCG 2004 banners and certificates being distributed**

The event structure is confirmed by [GameSpot](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/long-beach-to-host-us-finals-for-world-cyber-games/1100-6105234/) — 25 Team USA members were selected across all games. Known USA UT2004 finalists stryfe and CombatCarl (who Scudder says were present) are [documented](https://liquipedia.net/arenafps/World_Cyber_Games/2004/UT2K4) as placing 5th–8th at the Grand Final in San Francisco.
