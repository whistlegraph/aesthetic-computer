# KidLisp x FF-X1 Integration Proposal

## The Story ðŸŽ¨

A 7-year-old sits in front of the FF-X1 TV with colorful word cards. 

They speak into the phone: "Purple!" 
The TV fills with purple. 

"Line!" 
A white line appears. 

"Scroll!" 
Everything starts moving. 

Mom says "that's beautiful!" and taps "Keep" on the phone. For $5, it becomes a unique NFT in their wallet.

## Why This Works for FF-X1 ðŸ“º

â€¢ **Family adoption**: Families buy more devices because kids create instead of just consume
â€¢ **Revenue test**: Every "keep" generates $5 split between all parties 
â€¢ **Gallery opportunities**: Showcase amazing kid art on Feral File
â€¢ **Technical integration**: iframe + postMessage (already built)

## The Keep Fee Structure ðŸ’°

**$5 "keep" fee breakdown:**
- Creator: 92.5%
- Feral File: 2.5% 
- Aesthetic Computer: 2.5%
- Objkt marketplace: 2.5%

*This creates sustainable revenue while keeping focus on creativity over commerce.*

## Engineering Status âœ…

- **KidLisp voice coding system** (working)
- **Auto wallet generation with @handles** (working)
- **Code sharing with $abc123 shortcuts** (working)
- **Tezos FA2 integration** (scaffolded, ready to deploy)
- **DP-1 playlist support** (working)

## The Vision ðŸŒˆ

FF-X1 becomes the device that teaches kids they're creators, not just consumers. Every family wants one. Every kid becomes a programmer-artist.

*What do you think? Want to turn some kids into digital artists?* ðŸ˜Š

*P.S. - I keep thinking about that 7-year-old's face when they realize they just made their first piece with magic words.*
