**Generated:** February 2, 2026

---

## Current Revenue Streams

### 1. 🎁 **Donations ("Give")** — `give.aesthetic.computer`
| Type | Options | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| One-time | $5, $10, $25, $50, $100, custom | ✅ Active |
| Monthly | Same tiers, recurring | ✅ Active |
| Currencies | USD, DKK | ✅ Active |
| PayPal | $1-$2,500 | ✅ Active |
| Tezos | `aesthetic.tez` | ✅ Passive |

**💡 Optimization:** This is pure donation — no value exchange. Consider adding donor perks (early access, name in credits, special badge).

---

### 2. 📖 **Sotce.net Subscription**
A paid diary network (partnership with Sotce).
- Handle registration
- Page reading access  
- Chat features

**Status:** ✅ Active (Stripe subscription)

**💡 Optimization:** Unknown pricing — verify it's competitive. Consider annual discount tier.

---

### 3. 🖨️ **Print-on-Demand (Printful)**

| Product | Price | Your Cut |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Sticker (5.5" square) | ~$10 total | ~$1 processing fee |
| Ceramic Mug (11oz) | Variable | Markup over cost |

**Status:** ✅ Active

**💡 Optimization:** The $1 "processing fee" is your only margin on stickers. Consider:
- Raising the fee to $2-3
- Adding more products (t-shirts, posters, prints)
- Promoting this feature more visibly

---

### 4. 🛒 **Shopify Store** — `shop.aesthetic.computer`
Books, records, artworks from "Home page" collection.

**Status:** ✅ Active

**💡 Optimization:** Not sure what's listed — ensure inventory is updated and promoted.

---

### 5. 🎟️ **Botce Tickets**
- **Price:** $6 per ticket
- Limited-use (2 clicks, 24hr access)

**Status:** ✅ Active

**💡 Optimization:** Consider ticket bundles or season pass.

---

### 6. 🪙 **KidLisp Keeps (NFTs)**
- **Your revenue:** $0 — users only pay Tezos gas
- **Contract:** `KT1JEVyKjsMLts63e4CNaMUywWTPgeQ41Smi`
- **Platform:** Listed on objkt.com

**Status:** 🟡 Active but **NO REVENUE**

**💡 Optimization:** This is your biggest missed opportunity!
- Add a small minting fee (2-5 ꜩ ≈ $2-5)
- Implement secondary sale royalties (5-10%)
- The infrastructure exists, just need contract update

## 🚨 Quick Wins (Lowest Effort, Highest Impact)

### 1. **Add Keep Minting Fee** — Est. +$50-500/month
```
Current: Free (users pay only gas)
Proposed: 2-5 ꜩ per keep (~$2-5)
```
Every keep minted = immediate revenue. You already have users minting!

### 2. **Increase Sticker Processing Fee** — Est. +$20-50/month
```
Current: $1.00 processing fee
Proposed: $2.50-3.00
```
People already paying $10 won't balk at $11-12.

### 3. **Donation Perks** — Est. +20-50% donations
```
$5/mo → Name in supporters list
$10/mo → Early access to features
$25/mo → Monthly 1:1 call or Q&A
```

### 4. **Promote What Exists**
Your give page, stickers, and shop exist but may not be visible enough in the UI.
