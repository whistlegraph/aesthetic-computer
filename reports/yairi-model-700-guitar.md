### DIY Paper Bridge Experiment
- **Material:** Cut-up deck of playing cards

- **Feel:** Lower action feel
- **Notes:** Loved the "paper" bridge sound for its mellowness

## Observations & Preferences

| Setup | Tone | Feel | Liked? |
|-------|------|------|--------|
| Paper (cards) saddle | Deep, soft, warm | Low action | ✓ Loved it |
| Bone saddle + John Pearse | Twangy, bright, articulate | Standard | ✓ Sounds awesome |

**Conflict:** Likes the bright twangy sound of bone but misses the low feel from the paper setup.

---

## Ideas to Explore

1. **Lower the bone saddle** - Sand bottom evenly to reduce action while keeping bright tone
2. **Tusq saddle** - Synthetic material, tone between bone and paper
3. **Hybrid approach** - Paper/felt shim under bass side of bone saddle for warm lows + bright trebles
4. **Heavier bass strings** - Could restore some of that deep low-end warmth

## Maintenance Log

| Date | Work Done |
|------|-----------|
| Jan 31, 2026 | Switched back to bone saddle from paper/card bridge |

## Notes
- Bone transfers energy more efficiently to soundtop = more overtones, better projection
- Paper absorbs high-frequency vibrations = warmer, softer attack, less sustain
- Both are valid choices depending on desired sound
