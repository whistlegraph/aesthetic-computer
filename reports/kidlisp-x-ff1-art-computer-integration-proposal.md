**AC Summer Development (August 2025) - @jeffrey**


Thanks to your funding and help I have a number of features in production now ready to integrate with your stack as you approach a critical hardware and app launch this fall. I'm especially excited about the interactivity, composability and share-ability that writing KidLisp provides and every piece of KidLisp on AC is now automatically published, stored, and attributed to the author so it can be sequenced into dynamic playlists according to your spec. In the next week I'll be polishing off the 'make' prototype to work with the KidLisp system in addition to bringing in musical features from 'clock' (our first prototype!) so KidLisp pieces can be both visual and musical. Then I'll focus on user interactivity and games as outputs from all that.

**Current Status Update (September 2025) - Sean**

Only 25 **FF1s** (v2 hardware) shipped so far; fewer than 5 devices are likely in daily use. Another 50 devices will ship in the next 1‚Äì2 weeks. This is a modest bump, but still not a large audience. (We're pivoting from Intel to AMD, which means new hardware.) Public announcement is set for Thursday, September 4, with pre-orders planned for the third week of September. On the software side, **Orbit-0** (Gold-Path Core) shipped in August. It proves the simplest path: power on, scan a QR, say "show me 36 Points," and art plays in under 30 seconds. That milestone matters because it validates the device end-to-end and sets the bar for speed and stability. **Orbit-1** (Collection Core) is scheduled for release mid-September. It adds personal collection sync and address indexing, so users can pull in their own works from Ethereum/Tezos, plus a revamped Collection view in the app. We also have a draft **DP-1** extension for Channels. We're building this for Feral File Exhibitions and in collaboration with Objkt, who plan to bring their galleries and a daily feed into **FF1**. An Aesthetic Computer channel could be another direction, with interactive, shareable elements tied to **FF1** or **DP-1**.

**The Request (September 2025) - Sean**

Could you propose 3‚Äì5 experiment concepts framed around these constraints? Ideally, they're low-friction ways to make **FF1** experiences more engaging for our small group of users, with a playful social twist and a simple revenue test. Building on **DP-1** is welcome if it fits naturally.

## üåü Picture this...

A 7-year-old sits in front of the **TV with FF1 Art Computer plugged in**, speaks simple commands into the **iPhone with FF Orbit-0 open** while reading code words off of colorful cards on the coffee table:

**`purple`** 

<iframe src="https://aesthetic.computer/purple?nolabel=true&nogap=true&tv=true" width="480" height="300" frameborder="0"></iframe>

*The entire TV screen fills with purple, a standardized CSS color name.*

**`ink, line`** 

<iframe src="https://aesthetic.computer/purple,%20ink,%20line?nolabel=true&nogap=true&tv=true&highlight=%230000FF" width="480" height="300" frameborder="0"></iframe>

*The ink color changes as lines appear.*

**`scroll`** 

<iframe src="https://aesthetic.computer/purple,%20ink,%20line,%20scroll?nolabel=true&nogap=true&tv=true" width="480" height="300" frameborder="0"></iframe>

*The whole picture drifts continuously.*

**`blur`** 

<iframe src="https://aesthetic.computer/purple,%20ink,%20line,%20scroll,%20blur?nolabel=true&nogap=true&tv=true" width="480" height="300" frameborder="0"></iframe>

*The image softens into a dreamy coud.*

Mom says *"That's beautiful! Should we keep it?"* Kid nods excitedly. Mom scans QR code to view the piece on her own device and then taps 'Keep' and pays a **5 Íú©** keep fee to be the first official keeper of this piece and hold it in her wallet. The picture in the corner of the TV now flashes `kept by @mom`.

Mom says *"Thanks!"* and says into **FF Orbit-0**: **`make a written thank you!`**:

<iframe src="https://aesthetic.computer/make%20a%20written%20thank%20you!?nolabel=true&nogap=true&tv=true" width="640" height="420" frameborder="0"></iframe>

*KidLisp code gets generated on-screen forming cute reply.*

## üí∞ The "Keep" Fee (Revenue Test)

**When a family hits `Keep` (5 Íú© total):**
- **Creator (Child)**: 3 Íú© (60%) - *Goes to their wallet/college fund*
- **Feral File**: 1 Íú© (20%) - *Platform and curation*
- **Aesthetic Computer**: 1 Íú© (20%) - *KidLisp Runtime and Storage*

This structure incentivizes creativity over commerce while building sustainable revenue for all parties.

## üí≠ü§ñ Claude's thoughts...

*The following analysis and recommendations are based on Claude Sonnet 4's comprehensive examination of the Aesthetic Computer repository, including 589+ interactive pieces, the complete KidLisp interpreter, social networking infrastructure, and creative computing architecture. These insights reflect deep patterns observed in the current system architecture and transformative potential for FF1 Art Computer integration. But they were not fully combed by @jeffrey for accuracy
or importance other than basic prompting and querying of the repo. *

### **Technical Architecture**

The Aesthetic Computer codebase represents a distributed system for interactive media creation with several architectural components relevant to FF1 integration.

#### üß† **The KidLisp Interpreter: Core Language Implementation**
The core `kidlisp.mjs` file contains 8553 lines implementing a domain-specific language for creative computing:

- **Real-time compilation**: Code executes with immediate visual/audio feedback
- **Simplified syntax**: Commands like `(wipe "purple")`, `(ink "red")`, `(circle 100 100 50)`
- **Standard programming constructs**: Function definitions, loops, conditionals, mathematical operations
- **Media integration**: Graphics, sound, user input, and networking APIs
- **Code composition**: The `$` syntax enables cached code snippets to be embedded in larger works

**Actual KidLisp examples from the notebook files:**

```lisp
; From hello.ipynb - Animation with timing
(fps 24)
(0.25s (wipe (... red yellow blue)))
(ink green)
(line 0 height/2 width height/2)
(ink red)
(line width/2 0 width/2 height)
(scroll frame frame)
```

```lisp
; From hello.ipynb - Music integration
(ink rainbow)
(line)
(melody "cdefgabagfed" 320)
```

```lisp
; From hello.ipynb - Visual effects with cross pattern
(wipe "blue")
(ink "red")
(line 0 0 width height)
(line width 0 0 height)
```

```lisp
; From hello.ipynb - Advanced clock with musical notation
clock +ceg e.b..c..d..e.. ++a...babababgfgfgfededefga
```

The language design prioritizes immediate feedback and removes syntax barriers that typically discourage beginner programmers.

#### üåê **System Infrastructure**
The AC architecture includes networking and social features built on specific backend platforms:

**Backend Stack:**
- **Database**: MongoDB with connection pooling for user data, chat messages, and piece storage
- **Session Management**: JamSocket-based session backends for real-time multiplayer experiences
- **Authentication**: Custom token-based authorization system via `authorize()` API
- **Chat System**: Real-time WebSocket chat infrastructure with `chat-system.aesthetic.computer` endpoint
- **Storage**: IndexedDB for client-side persistence, server-side MongoDB for permanence
- **Logging**: Centralized logging system with HTTP POST to chat-system for error reporting

**Core Features:**
- **User identity**: Persistent `@handle` system with authentication tokens
- **Real-time collaboration**: `channel` system enables multi-device synchronization  
- **Publishing pipeline**: Code storage, attribution, and distribution mechanisms
- **Cross-platform support**: Web, mobile, and TV interface compatibility
- **Blockchain integration**: Tezos FA2 contract infrastructure for ownership and transactions

**Media Recording (`tape` system):**
The `tape` functionality enables frame-accurate recording of AC pieces:
- **Frame-based recording**: Captures exact number of frames for deterministic playback
- **Time-based recording**: Duration-based capture for real-time performances  
- **Multiple formats**: Exports to WebP (animated), PNG sequences, ZIP archives
- **Persistence**: IndexedDB storage for recordings across browser sessions
- **Integration**: Works across all pieces - `tape notepat` records musical performances

#### üé® **Content Library: 589+ Interactive Pieces**
The `/disks/` directory contains a substantial collection of interactive components:

- **Musical tools**: `notepat` (2069 lines), `metronome`, `chord`, `visualizer`
- **Drawing utilities**: `line`, `rect`, `shape`, `smear`, `stamp`, `brush`
- **Interactive experiences**: `scawy-snake`, `cards`, `play`, `gamepad`
- **System tools**: `chat`, `list`, `share`, `download`, `print`
- **Experimental pieces**: `freaky-flowers`, `girlfriend`, `stage`, `video`

Each piece functions as a self-contained module that can be forked and modified.

**Community and Social Features:**
- **Chat system**: Real-time messaging integrated into every piece via `chat.mjs` (1170 lines)
- **Handle system**: Users get persistent `@username` identities for publishing and attribution
- **Publishing**: Any user can `publish` their creations to make them publicly accessible
- **Forking**: All published pieces can be examined with `source` command and modified
- **QR sharing**: Every piece generates shareable QR codes for physical-digital bridges
- **Collaborative spaces**: `channel custom-name` creates shared creative sessions across devices

The community culture emphasizes **creative learning over competition** - pieces are shared to inspire and teach rather than to compete for attention. The `chat` system enables real-time help and collaboration, with experienced users mentoring newcomers.
