# 🎨 AC x FF-X1 Integration Proposal

## 📧 Email Context & Background

### **Original Opportunity (May 2025)**

**Sean Moss-Pultz wrote:**
> I've been thinking a lot about what we need most at Feral File right now—and I keep coming back to this: we have to make art, specifically digital art, something people do every day. Not just something they scroll past or collect occasionally, but something they engage with, return to, and ideally share with others.
> 
> And the truth is, like going to a museum or gallery, the experience is almost always better when it's done with friends. I think that's the core of the problem we haven't cracked yet.
> 
> We already have the Daily—a single artwork curated from our collection each day, visible across our website, mobile apps (+widgets), and eventually the Portal (FF-X1) device. But the experience still feels solo. Quiet. Disconnected.
> 
> What I'd like to explore is: **What would it take to make the Daily feel like a multiplayer experience?** Something alive. Something social. Something that gives people a reason to show up again tomorrow—not just because of the art, but because of the connections around it.

### **Current Status Update (September 2025)**

**Sean's latest update:**
> Only 25 FF1s (v2 hardware) shipped so far; fewer than 5 devices are likely in daily use. Another 50 devices will ship in the next 1–2 weeks. This is a modest bump, but still not a large audience. (We're pivoting from Intel to AMD, which means new hardware.)
> 
> Public announcement is set for Thursday, September 4, with pre-orders planned for the third week of September.
> 
> On the software side, Orbit-0 (Gold-Path Core) shipped in August. It proves the simplest path: power on, scan a QR, say "show me 36 Points," and art plays in under 30 seconds. That milestone matters because it validates the device end-to-end and sets the bar for speed and stability.
> 
> Orbit-1 (Collection Core) is scheduled for release mid-September. It adds personal collection sync and address indexing, so users can pull in their own works from Ethereum/Tezos, plus a revamped Collection view in the app.
> 
> We also have a draft DP-1 extension for Channels. We're building this for Feral File Exhibitions and in collaboration with Objkt, who plan to bring their galleries and a daily feed into FF1. An Aesthetic Computer channel could be another direction, with interactive, shareable elements tied to FF1 or DP-1.

### **The Request**

**Sean asked for:**
> Could you propose 3–5 experiment concepts framed around these constraints? Ideally, they're low-friction ways to make FF1 experiences more engaging for our small group of users, with a playful social twist and a simple revenue test. Building on DP-1 is welcome if it fits naturally.

### **AC Summer Development**

**Jeffrey's progress summary:**
> Thanks to your funding and help I have a number of features in production now ready to integrate with your stack as you approach a critical hardware and app launch this fall.
> 
> I'm especially excited about the interactivity, composability and share-ability that writing KidLisp provides and every piece of KidLisp on AC is now automatically published, stored, and attributed to the author so it can be sequenced into dynamic playlists according to your spec.
> 
> In the next week I'll be polishing off the 'make' prototype to work with the KidLisp system in addition to bringing in musical features from 'clock' (our first prototype!) so KidLisp pieces can be both visual and musical. Then I'll focus on user interactivity and games as outputs from all that.

## 🌟 The Integration

A 7-year-old sits in front of the **TV with FF-X1 plugged in**, types simple commands into the **iPhone with FF app open**:

**`purple`** 

<iframe src="http://local.aesthetic.computer/purple?nolabel=true&nogap=true&tv=true" width="320" height="240" frameborder="0"></iframe>

*The entire TV screen fills with a rich purple canvas.*

**`ink rainbow`** 

<iframe src="http://local.aesthetic.computer/purple§ink%20rainbow?nolabel=true&nogap=true&tv=true" width="320" height="240" frameborder="0"></iframe>

*Colors shift and blend into a beautiful rainbow palette.*

**`line`** 

<iframe src="http://local.aesthetic.computer/purple§ink%20rainbow§line?nolabel=true&nogap=true&tv=true" width="320" height="240" frameborder="0"></iframe>

*A crisp line cuts through the rainbow ink.*

**`scroll`** 

<iframe src="http://local.aesthetic.computer/purple§ink%20rainbow§line§scroll?nolabel=true&nogap=true&tv=true" width="320" height="240" frameborder="0"></iframe>

*Everything starts moving in mesmerizing patterns.*

**`blur`** 

<iframe src="http://local.aesthetic.computer/purple§ink%20rainbow§line§scroll§blur?nolabel=true&nogap=true&tv=true" width="320" height="240" frameborder="0"></iframe>

*The creation softens into a dreamy, blurred masterpiece.*

Mom says *"That's beautiful! Should we keep it?"* Kid nods excitedly. Mom scans QR code, performs transaction, pays **5 ꜩ** fee.

Mom says *"That was beautiful!"* and types **`make a heart`**:

<iframe src="http://local.aesthetic.computer/make%20a%20heart?nolabel=true&nogap=true&tv=true" width="320" height="240" frameborder="0"></iframe>

*A simple, perfect heart appears on the TV screen - the system's way of saying thank you.*

### **Social Twist**
- **Live Gallery Feed**: All kept creations appear in real-time on other FF-X1s
- **Creative Chains**: Kids can extend each other's art by adding one command
- **Daily Challenges**: "Today's challenge is 'make a robot' - what can you create?"

### **Revenue Test**
- **5 ꜩ per keep** (92.5% to creator wallet, 7.5% platform fees)
- **Conservative target**: 1 keep per user per week = 260 ꜩ/year per household

## 🚀 Why This Changes Everything for FF-X1

### **The Family Adoption Multiplier**
- **Problem**: Families often buy one device that kids fight over
- **Solution**: FF-X1 becomes the centerpiece where kids **create together** instead of competing for screen time
- **Result**: Families want multiple FF-X1s - one for the living room, one for the playroom, maybe one for grandma's house

### **Revenue Test in Real Time** 
- Every **`Keep`** generates immediate **5 ꜩ revenue** split across the ecosystem
- Parents willingly pay because they're preserving genuine creative moments
- Kids learn that their art has value without the pressure of "selling"
- **Conservative estimate**: 1 keep per week per family = 260 ꜩ/year additional revenue per household

### **Gallery & Exhibition Opportunities**
- Showcase the most amazing kid creations on **Feral File's main gallery**
- **"Future Programmers"** exhibition featuring 6-12 year old digital artists
- **"Family Code"** shows where parents and kids collaborated
- Media coverage writes itself: *"The 8-year-old who coded her way into a major art gallery"*

### **Technical Integration (Already Built)**
- **KidLisp voice-to-code system**: Working and battle-tested
- **iframe embedding**: Clean, responsive, works perfectly
- **postMessage communication**: Phone app ↔ TV seamless
- **Wallet integration**: Auto-generates wallets with friendly @handles

---

## 💰 The Keep Fee Structure
*Simple, Fair, Sustainable*

**When a family hits `Keep` (5 ꜩ total):**
- **Creator (Child)**: 4.625 ꜩ (92.5%) - *Goes to their wallet/college fund*
- **Feral File**: 0.125 ꜩ (2.5%) - *Platform and curation*
- **Aesthetic Computer**: 0.125 ꜩ (2.5%) - *Voice coding infrastructure*
- **Tezos Network**: 0.125 ꜩ (2.5%) - *Blockchain and marketplace fees*

This structure incentivizes creativity over commerce while building sustainable revenue for all parties.

- **Documentation**: Every piece includes the voice recording of creation

---

## 🌈 The Vision (What Happens Next)

**Year 1**: FF-X1 becomes known as "the creative device" that families actually want their kids using. Every household with young children considers it essential.

**Year 2**: The first "Digital Native" art exhibition features exclusively KidLisp creations. A 9-year-old's piece sells for 500 ꜩ.

**Year 3**: High schools start offering "Voice Coding" as an art elective. Universities recruit students based on their childhood KidLisp portfolios.

**Year 5**: We've documented the creative development of an entire generation of digital artists, from their first "purple" to their college applications.
