A response to Casey Reas's essay on the distinction between digital art and NFTs -- and why naming the medium matters for platforms like Aesthetic Computer.

## The Essay

Reas -- co-creator of Processing, artist, and one of the most important figures in computational art -- draws a sharp line between two concepts that popular discourse has collapsed into one.

**Digital art** is a medium with a lineage stretching back to the 1960s: Frieder Nake, Vera Molnar, Charles Csuri, Harold Cohen. It refers to works created, stored, and presented through digital technologies, where code is the creative material.

**NFTs** are a mechanism -- a specific technological layer for recording ownership on a blockchain. They emerged in the 2017-2021 window and became burdened by speculative market associations.

Reas argues that conflating these terms obscures artistic history. When a generative work minted on-chain is called "an NFT" rather than "digital art," it gets severed from decades of computational art tradition and reduced to a financial instrument. The naming convention determines whether the work inherits a rich aesthetic lineage or gets filed under cryptocurrency speculation.

> Blockchain registration provides ownership documentation and economic frameworks, but doesn't determine aesthetic or conceptual substance.

The distinction matters because it shapes how audiences, institutions, and artists themselves understand the work. Call it an NFT and people hear "speculative asset." Call it digital art and they hear "creative practice with a sixty-year history."

## AC Already Made This Choice

Aesthetic Computer's architecture embodies Reas's distinction without ever having to argue for it. Pieces are not minted, listed, or traded. They are played, published, and forked. The URL IS the address -- not a wallet, not a marketplace, not a token ID.

When someone visits @handle/piece-name, they encounter a running program -- not a certificate of ownership. The piece boots, acts, sims, and paints. It has behavior, not provenance. AC chose the medium over the mechanism from the start, which means it never inherited the NFT's identity crisis.

This is not an anti-NFT position. It is a design decision about what the primary frame of reference should be. Reas's essay articulates why that framing matters: it determines what tradition you belong to, and therefore what questions you ask about your own work.

## Processing and AC Share a Root

Reas co-created Processing in 2001 with Ben Fry. Processing's insight was that creative coding needed its own environment -- not a plugin for Photoshop, not a framework within Java (though it ran on the JVM), but a dedicated context where code and visual output were unified. The sketch metaphor -- boot, draw, loop -- gave computational artists a lifecycle model instead of an event-driven GUI framework.

AC's piece lifecycle (boot/act/sim/paint) is a direct descendant of this idea. Both systems treat creative programs as living processes with temporal structure, not static outputs. Both insist on immediate-mode rendering. Both prioritize making over configuring.

Where Processing produced standalone sketches, AC produces networked pieces with URLs, social identity, and a shared runtime. The evolution is from "creative coding environment" to "creative computing platform" -- but the philosophical root is identical: code as medium, running program as artwork.

## Why Naming Matters for Instruments

Reas's argument about naming conventions maps onto AC's instrument metaphor. If you call a piece a "tool," users approach it with extraction in mind -- use it, get output, move on. If you call it an "instrument," users approach it with practice in mind -- learn it, develop skill, return to it.

Similarly, if you call digital art "NFTs," audiences approach it with investment logic -- buy low, sell high, check the floor price. If you call it "digital art," they approach it with aesthetic attention -- what does it do, how does it feel, what tradition does it extend?

AC pieces are instruments. Reas insists that computational artworks are art. Both positions resist the reduction of creative artifacts to their economic wrapper. The naming is not pedantic -- it determines the entire relationship between maker, work, and audience.

## The Sixty-Year Conversation

The most valuable move in Reas's essay is reconnecting contemporary blockchain-based generative work to the 1960s pioneers. Nake's matrix multiplications, Molnar's geometric permutations, Cohen's AARON -- these were digital art before the term existed. Today's generative artists working with on-chain systems are extending this lineage, not inventing a new one.

AC's disks directory is its own version of this continuity. Each .mjs and .lisp file in the archive is a node in an ongoing conversation about what computation can express aesthetically. The pieces accumulate -- not as assets in a portfolio but as entries in a living practice. Some are rough. Some are beautiful. All of them are programs that run, and that is what makes them art in the tradition Reas describes.

KidLisp makes this lineage particularly explicit. Its parenthetical syntax, its immediate visual feedback, its constraint-based grammar -- these are closer to the spirit of 1960s computer art than most contemporary creative coding tools. When a user writes (wipe 0 0 40) (ink 255 200 100) (circle 50 50 20), they are participating in the same tradition as Nake writing matrix transformations in ALGOL. The medium is the code. The mechanism is irrelevant.

Reas's essay is a taxonomy argument, and taxonomy arguments matter because they determine community, canon, and critique. Call something an NFT and it gets evaluated by market metrics. Call it digital art and it gets evaluated by artistic ones. AC chose its taxonomy early: pieces are programs, programs are instruments, instruments are played. No ownership layer, no marketplace, no floor price. Just boot, act, sim, paint -- the sixty-year-old conversation, continuing.
