Lesson NOT Learnt 01 —— The failure of academic identity politics 

// Right outside the house were I live, > a Celtic churce-settlement has been found only a #few years ago#—§ This changes the whole idea of Faroish identity completly as most modern - inovativ self-brand-building youngsters on the island’s now ses a opotunity to make up a new history around themself as: Ancient Celts and by that pushing aside, the Sagas of the Icelanders, there otherwise has been the concept of real Nordic - national - IDEAS OF HOME - now the most clever of us are Celtic and hates on Norway and Black Metal etc. - But this is down-right a fantasy - as most people here is a >>-bio-dna-product-<< of sailors and shipping trafic routes… 'nuff said here.

Most identity politics is based on getting a place at the power and capitalist-table on the expense of any scientific or historical facts - YES - This is wonderfull and I can only bee-sing it and enjoy as I myself has changed my acent, history, origin etc. — many a time, in order to fit in and make myself intereting and doing so in a way there was playing whit fact the same way as the already mentioned the Saga’s. (((Were is The Goodiepal from etc.)))

______Just as K-omputer hacking was inteligent and realativly harmless to begin whit,  it is now a days turned into only being about getting money out of old and lesser informed on-liner’s - The Academic identity hacking and story building people use today could be said to share the same faith ((—- maybe?? —)) At least almost all Scandinavien academics only research in fields they are payed in Capital to researh and people in the needs of power ar desperate to build new world views and history’s to fit into … just look at teh Balkan changes over the last 30 years for another example - and I guess it is more or less the same anywere else… Butthen agian  this is only some Celtic fantasy thought’s - they have no relevance now, but give them a few years…

Lesson NOT Learnt 02 
—Hang whit the wrong — Let’s go and in ART find the queer·ness of the left-wing >>>> and mash it ..into.. the outsider art of the modern right-wing ___ Here we could include all the social free thinkers dreams like: modular synth’s, bright-colours etc. — & —gently blendt it whit things from the right’ers - that could includ re·li·gious heart-to-brush painting technics & nordic sing-a-song writer traditions etc.  — Do not hold back, but please go give it a try - § § § __ The hopefull conclution should be that, the so called right- and left-wing talk is something from the old France Revolution, that is of today, in no way, a good illustrative way to descrip the strugles and political mind-sets the youth is trying to navigate in…

__ The workers on a Norwigien `oil-platform’ has a much better idea of what they everyday work destory’s, then let’s say a Ethereum-Space Karen-Dogecoin-investor, happy in the Berlin Cryto-Capital section of the ART-market, if a Rough-Neck on the Rig sings a song, please listen to it before you judge that person - there is always some things to learn,  don't just doubt ur vibe…

If you are a Hawaii’en native working on: the Pituffik Space Base and is on leave in Thorshavn on the Faroe Islands, your ART— %% even if you call it: “just a hobby” %% might tell a intereting story about: in·dig·e·nous'nes and enviromental destruction — even thow that you are in the uniform…

in ART so in life - trust your heart - not what your phone tells you... The only exception here is phone-ART...

Lesson NOT Learnt 03

Purano Sei Diner Kothis & The Guild of the Viking Klokkers

I only like words in songs and not _general sytax—> as it is the destroy’er of EMO ideas. << For: Bananskolen I tryed NOT to be: Karin Hansson & Åse Andersson’s: _TED (Beta 0.3)__ but was / is still iinternally in the gruppe sean as that person (& as I become of age, I really DO hate being in focus - - - -belive it or not), - - - - But all this brings something interesting to the table, a lot of current intellectualism and Academic discussion’s is actually not about the subject but more about hove the gruppe feels internaly.

This = the failure of modern debate in general
- As it is the unspoken-gruppe stucture that makes the individuals spar·kle and not the $ rules $ that govern hove the gruppe is organised; who is allowed to speak etc. & I do really believe that any political idea is just another power system waiting to be put into place. . .

- As for now 2000 & HVAD - we try: The Guild of the Viking Klokkers

01 - if you live in København and owens a flat, you are 3 - 4 X milionar!
02 - if you live in København and owens a house, you are around 12 X milionar!
03 - if you live in København and owens more then one house, you are economicaly diretly responsible for the >current< WARS in this world —> København’ers - get super super angry when I raise this openion, in everyday talk… — Part of my current life struge is a product of just that —>  So In life, NEVER should one owen more then 1 X house… else you are a Scandi-Tycoon. 
Most Scandi_tycoon’s dos de-emphasize in style and expense and does not show of there weath in the form of Watches & Jewelry etc. 

FRONT your wealth - Do not owen a house - if people will NOT house you, when you come to town your so called ART - is simply not good enough…

Lesson NOT Learnt 06
*
Silence is the power of any overclass, anywere
*
& Fansy political ideas is all the same - just power structures waiting to be put into place... — well educated Euro's who jumps on a fashionable idea.. and talk to a lower class in order to highen them to another >>mille plateaux<<- But fails to interact whit the class whit’s way of life the well educated Euro's certainly can't stand.. Just Like the fishers living in Vorupør and the bikers who en·gaged in a fight of 300 people around 30 years ago in that little town -  and the white institutional overclass only had silence as a comment - since silence is the way that intelectualisem deals whit ideas it dos not like... = silence is wrong & conceptual high modernism was a dead - NO it is / was not!

Lesson NOT Learnt 09
The modern art-critic of today, has huge problems acepting - reversed signals as a comunication form…’’’
$$$ But no Euro-industiral Culture - could ever had existed whitout possing in Euro facist-left owers and in that way critisising the modern, the new & the global world there was to come…

Dungeon & Draogns cost-play and so called gay culture was pre-industrial framworks, lets line it up:

Dungeon & Draogns cost-play and (gay) culture > Industrial - revesed signals culture > Cyber Punk > Internet > Tekno  > Global Village Dreams > Social Media & web 2.0  > The curret Politcal Art-scene…

and that current art-scene would never accept a man·ly Dungeon & Dragons cost-play picture like this:
