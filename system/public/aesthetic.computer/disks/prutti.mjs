    // Right outside the house were I live, > a Celtic churce-settlement has been found only a #few years ago#—§ This changes the whole idea of Faroish identity completly as most modern - inovativ self-brand-building youngsters on the island's now ses a opotunity to make up a new history around themself as: Ancient Celts and by that pushing aside, the Sagas of the Icelanders, there otherwise has been the concept of real Nordic - national - IDEAS OF HOME - now the most clever of us are Celtic and hates on Norway and Black Metal etc. - But this is down-right a fantasy - as most people here is a >>-bio-dna-product-<< of sailors and shipping trafic routes… 'nuff said here.

    Most identity politics is based on getting a place at the power and capitalist-table on the expense of any scientific or historical facts - YES - This is wonderfull and I can only bee-sing it and enjoy as I myself has changed my acent, history, origin etc. — many a time, in order to fit in and make myself intereting and doing so in a way there was playing whit fact the same way as the already mentioned the Saga's. (((Were is The Goodiepal from etc.)))

    ______Just as K-omputer hacking was inteligent and realativly harmless to begin whit,  it is now a days turned into only being about getting money out of old and lesser informed on-liner's - The Academic identity hacking and story building people use today could be said to share the same faith ((—- maybe?? —)) At least almost all Scandinavien academics only research in fields they are payed in Capital to researh and people in the needs of power ar desperate to build new world views and history's to fit into … just look at teh Balkan changes over the last 30 years for another example - and I guess it is more or less the same anywere else… Butthen agian  this is only some Celtic fantasy thought's - they have no relevance now, but give them a few years…

    Let's go and in ART find the queer·ness of the left-wing >>>> and mash it ..into.. the outsider art of the modern right-wing ___ Here we could include all the social free thinkers dreams like: modular synth's, bright-colours etc. — & —gently blendt it whit things from the right'ers - that could includ re·li·gious heart-to-brush painting technics & nordic sing-a-song writer traditions etc.  — Do not hold back, but please go give it a try - § § § __ The hopefull conclution should be that, the so called right- and left-wing talk is something from the old France Revolution, that is of today, in no way, a good illustrative way to descrip the strugles and political mind-sets the youth is trying to navigate in…

    __ The workers on a Norwigien 'oil-platform' has a much better idea of what they everyday work destory's, then let's say a Ethereum-Space Karen-Dogecoin-investor, happy in the Berlin Cryto-Capital section of the ART-market, if a Rough-Neck on the Rig sings a song, please listen to it before you judge that person - there is always some things to learn,  don't just doubt ur vibe…

    If you are a Hawaii'en native working on: the Pituffik Space Base and is on leave in Thorshavn on the Faroe Islands, your ART— %% even if you call it: “just a hobby” %% might tell a intereting story about: in·dig·e·nous'nes and enviromental destruction — even thow that you are in the uniform…

    in ART so in life - trust your heart - not what your phone tells you... The only exception here is phone-ART...

    I only like words in songs and not _general sytax—> as it is the destroy'er of EMO ideas. << For: Bananskolen I tryed NOT to be: Karin Hansson & Åse Andersson's: _TED (Beta 0.3)__ but was / is still iinternally in the gruppe sean as that person (& as I become of age, I really DO hate being in focus - - - -belive it or not), - - - - But all this brings something interesting to the table, a lot of current intellectualism and Academic discussion's is actually not about the subject but more about hove the gruppe feels internaly.

    This = the failure of modern debate in general
    - As it is the unspoken-gruppe stucture that makes the individuals spar·kle and not the $ rules $ that govern hove the gruppe is organised; who is allowed to speak etc. & I do really believe that any political idea is just another power system waiting to be put into place. . .

    03 - if you live in København and owens more then one house, you are economicaly diretly responsible for the >current< WARS in this world —> København'ers - get super super angry when I raise this openion, in everyday talk… — Part of my current life struge is a product of just that —>  So In life, NEVER should one owen more then 1 X house… else you are a Scandi-Tycoon.

    __Nobody can handle the wistful Goodiepal instrument-collection just like an: Eysturstein'er!__

    I have decided to create a small  SYNTH LIBRARY  on the Faro islands, or rather I have decided to put all, the music instruments, not just SYNTH's - that I own into a closet/ vetrine and make it all for ** FREE USE ** - you can come and take out what ever you like, bring it on the road to perform or home to play/ re·build just as long as you handle the ''TECH'' whit relative respect & care ________> and return it back and place it nedly into the same closet - when your actions are done whit.
    //------//
    You see, we as so called KLANG-artist's collect instruments like DRAGONS nesting on gold, & we never use the shit we collect - but why is it so?? Is it some strange left-over's from old picture's of Prog-Rock Bands, youtube-gear and videos & the insides of old Jean-Michel jarre record covers?

    ### BRING YOU SHIT TO USE ###

    I have always been ALL about FREE music and FREE this and that - and I will keep sharing whatever that I got, so that's why we are doing this - the KEY and coordinates to the collection is located at:

    BAR Sirkus Föroyar
    2 Gríms Kambansgøta
    Tórshavn 100,
    The Faroe Islands

    Yes - just ask for: Sunneva Eysturstein,  She has the key and will handle it over to you...

    $$$$$$ JUST SAY NO $$$$$$

    Normal Synth Library's work whit Donations, and Memberships and so on bla. bla. - But that already marginalize the concept, and the people who use it - lets make it totally free - ( NO ) DONATIONS - ( NO ) FUNDING, if something breaks let's meet once a year and fix it together ...

    __________________________________
    2023- 2024 Pruttipal - When you visited Fleisher/Ollman Gallery in Philadelphia (maybe in/around 2006), you mentioned that computers would "Neeeeever be able to tell" (emphasis yours) what is written in a distorted captcha.

    Despite my tragically terrible memory, I remember much of the event at F/OG quite clearly (and fondly). I believe in expansive thought and experimentation, so I was enthralled. With all the developments in AI over these past few years, do you still believe this to be true? Are you willing to concede that you were incorrect on this point? - I appreciate your time and your ideas. Also, you mentioned "Trust your heart, not what your phone tells you." I have a thought on this: in this world, 'heart' is generally synonymous with 'desire' (I would equate these words to the Sanskrit word 'chitta'). Even now, phones are able to recommend, with relative accuracy, what content a user may be interested in. I suggest that recommendations are nothing more than attempts at fulfilling the 'desires' of the user.__________________________________
    Given the rate of technological change and the current global investment in AI, do you feel that it is possible for a phone to more accurately predict the user's desires to a point where there is very little distinction between the two? Could it get to the point where our phones know us better than ourselves? And would this nourish our own understanding of ourselves, thus potentially bettering society?__________________________________
    Like I said, I'm a curious, thinking person. Sorry for the possibly irrelevant ideas and questions.

    Pluto existed before modern humans discovered the p-entity in 1930. Pluto exists after 2006 when Rational Thinking humans reclassified it. Pluto does not care BUT Pluto is not in solar system models because it is not a “planet” by the IAU definition. - bla bla bla.. Pluto is still a planet to Alice Pamuk & so it should be to you. PLUTO is a astronomical influencer - a title only a few can take…
    - Here a is a few personal lessons for me send by Pluto via Alice Pamuk.
    Learn from: Polle

    Learn from: Pippi@s father

    Learn from: FIONA Kruger

    Learn from: Christian Klings

    You see Pluto is right almost all the time…

    In order to communicate whit Pluto or Alice Pamuk you need Platinum, and Pluto is cheap from a modern human perspective but also fancy at the same time, so a perfect watch fit for the meeting would be a: SAWTCH made in platinum, like the one at the picture here…

    All stories is made up by events following each other, the more chaotic the events fall out the better the story, go and find signs in repetitions and intervals in events as your life takes place, they all have hidden code to tell you. And that hidden code is, if not decipherable then at least playable just like a board game.

    Real players and real——Chairman Of The Bored——like // Rank Sinatra // plays the game whit a platinum bar as a watch and a diamond on the crown… that is the only way or so I have been told. Ohhh // Rank // just Joined the guild of the viking klokkers. - on the picture you see my ingot (s)

    the true meaning of mastery

    To be real ---Saedfuck---m0e---based--- in - the now, you need to be able to take apart an Urban Jürgensen yourself, Carl oppermann and I did just that-YES YES-( I was cheerleading &  Carl did the hard work --no cap--)  - the former owner of this watch was ///Smadremanden///  Urban Jürgensen is known for their mastery of details, a distinction particularly well suited for the realm of pruttipal-horology… bla. bla. bla.  - But the reason that I'm telling you this, is that even not an Urban Jurgensen, that comes from a four-century long tradition of Danish-Swiss watchmaking etc. etc. ----is hardly making anything themself. It´s true... we just reverse engineered one ----

    The movement the (caliber P5) is made by one company, so is the watch chain etc. etc. Urban Jurgensen is simply putting there well designed things together --- That is what forms a modern ## Jurgensen -##  and this is the way you make MASTERY-things... - People there thinks that they should be good a everything ends up being bad at most things...

    Make your-self dependent on the expertise of your friends, I have done so in all aspects of my life, and is continuously doing so -- even though my surroundings is currently punishing me for doing so... oohhhh Smadremanden - JOINED THE GUILD of the Viking klokkers

    Pruttipal we eat all the crumbs - Saedfuck---m0e / Saedfuck---m0e / Saedfuck---m0e / Saedfuck---m0e
