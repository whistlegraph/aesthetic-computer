// Multipen, 22.09.04.16.18
// A basic example of multi-touch / multiple tracked cursors from one client,
// using both the `pen` API for the primary pointer and `pens` for the others,
// in addition to filtering "touch:2" for pointer no. 2 in `act`.

/*
TODO
- [] Modify this test to encompass N pointers.
- [] Add numbers next to each pointer.
- [] Figure out what to do when a new pointer gets added after the first one
     was lifted, but a second or third one is already down.
- [x] Draw a point for one cursor, and a line for two.
