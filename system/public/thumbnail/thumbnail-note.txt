***Thumbnails AKA Piece Covers***

Adding thumbnails or "covers" to this directory will overwrite
whether they are generated by the system.

- They must be jpegs and should be present in each
  subdirectory at the given resolution.

Thumbnails must be named directly their command: `nail` `metronome~80`, `wg`, `wg~puzz` etc.
