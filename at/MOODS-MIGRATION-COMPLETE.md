# Moods Migration to ATProto - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** Successfully completed  
**Total Moods Migrated:** 2,095 across 629 users

---

## üìä Migration Summary

### Successfully Migrated
- **629 users** with ATProto accounts
- **2,095 moods** synced to ATProto PDS
- **0 failures** during migration
- **100% success rate** for users with accounts

### Users Pending ATProto Accounts
- **355 users** need ATProto accounts created before their moods can be migrated
- Report saved at: `/workspaces/aesthetic-computer/users-without-atproto.json`

---

## üîÑ Migration Strategy Used

### Optimized Approach
1. **Find users with moods first** using MongoDB aggregation
2. **Check ATProto account status** (did + password)
3. **Migrate users with accounts**
4. **Flag users without accounts** for later processing

### Why This Approach?
- More efficient than checking all ATProto accounts first
- Clear reporting on which users need accounts
- No wasted queries on users without moods
- Better error tracking and recovery

---

## üéØ What Was Migrated

### Per-User Migration Process
For each user with an ATProto account:
1. Logged in to ATProto PDS using their credentials
2. Fetched all their moods from MongoDB (non-deleted only)
3. Created ATProto records with:
   - `mood`: The mood text (up to 5000 chars)
   - `when`: Original timestamp from MongoDB
   - `ref`: MongoDB `_id` for bi-directional lookup
4. Updated MongoDB with `atproto.rkey` for each mood
5. Tracked any errors in migration-errors.json

### Timestamp Preservation
- ATProto `createdAt`: Automatic (when record added to PDS)
- ATProto `when` field: Preserves original mood timestamp from MongoDB
- Ensures historical accuracy of mood data

---

## üìã Files Modified/Created

### Migration Scripts
- `/system/backend/migrate-all-users-moods.mjs` - Main migration script
  - Dry-run by default (`--migrate` flag to execute)
  - Skip users with `--skip=handle` flag
  - Generates detailed reports

### Reports Generated
- `/workspaces/aesthetic-computer/users-without-atproto.json`
  - 355 users need ATProto accounts
  - Includes handle, sub, mood count, email
  - Sorted by mood count (descending)

### No Migration Errors
- No `migration-errors.json` created (100% success rate)

---

## üîç Verification

### @jeffrey (Test User)
- Total moods: 224
- Synced to ATProto: 224
- All records have `atproto.rkey` in MongoDB
- All records have `ref` field in ATProto
- 0 duplicates found

### Overall Stats
```
Total users with moods: 984
With ATProto accounts: 629 (63.9%)
Without ATProto accounts: 355 (36.1%)
Successfully migrated: 629 users (100%)
Total moods migrated: 2,095
```

## ‚ö° Dual-Write Architecture (Production)

### New Moods
Going forward, all new moods automatically sync to both systems:

1. **POST to `/api/mood`**
2. **Insert to MongoDB** ‚Üí get `_id`
3. **Create ATProto record** with `ref: _id`
4. **Update MongoDB** with `atproto.rkey`
5. **Return success** (even if ATProto fails)

### Error Handling
- ATProto failures are logged but don't break mood creation
- MongoDB is source of truth
- Failed ATProto syncs can be retried later

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Create ATProto Accounts for Remaining Users
- 355 users in `users-without-atproto.json` need accounts
- Need to create DID on PDS
- Generate app passwords
- Update users collection with `atproto.did` and `atproto.password`

### 2. Re-run Migration for New Accounts
Once ATProto accounts are created:
```bash
cd /workspaces/aesthetic-computer/system
node backend/migrate-all-users-moods.mjs --skip=jeffrey --migrate
```

### 3. Update Delete/Forget Endpoint
- Add ATProto mood deletion to `delete-erase-and-forget-me.mjs`
- Use `deleteMoodFromAtproto()` from `mood-atproto.mjs`
- Ensures GDPR compliance across both systems

### 4. Test Dual-Write in Production
- Post new mood via web interface
- Verify it appears in both MongoDB and ATProto
- Confirm `atproto.rkey` is set in MongoDB
- Confirm `ref` field is set in ATProto
