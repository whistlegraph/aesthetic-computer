## üö´ Blocked Users (Cannot Get ATProto Accounts)

These 6 users have MongoDB records and moods but cannot get ATProto accounts:

## üìä Total Moods

- **Moods ready to migrate:** ~2,730 (from 978 users with ATProto)
- **Moods blocked:** 6 (from 6 users without ATProto)

## ‚úÖ Actions Taken

1. ‚úÖ Fixed backfill script to use real Auth0 emails (not fake @aesthetic.computer emails)
2. ‚úÖ Backfilled all 138+ missing legacy users from 2023
3. ‚úÖ Created ATProto accounts for 978 users
4. ‚úÖ Documented 6 edge cases that cannot be resolved automatically
5. ‚úÖ Updated migration script with documentation of blocked users

## üöÄ Next Steps

Run the final migration to sync all moods from MongoDB to ATProto:

```bash
cd /workspaces/aesthetic-computer/system/backend
PDS_URL=https://at.aesthetic.computer node migrate-all-users-moods.mjs --migrate
```

The migration script will automatically:
- Skip users without ATProto accounts (the 6 blocked users)
- Migrate ~2,730 moods for 978 users
- Show progress with mood text previews
- Generate a final report

## üìù Notes

- The 6 blocked users' MongoDB records are preserved
- Their moods remain in MongoDB only
- If issues are resolved in the future (email changes, Auth0 restored), they can be manually migrated
- Migration completion: **99.4%** (6 users out of 984 cannot be automatically migrated)
