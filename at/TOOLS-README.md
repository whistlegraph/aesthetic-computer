- Creates missing ATProto accounts
- One-time fix for the index conflict issue

**Historical use:** Fixed 5 users on Oct 14, 2025 after index conflict was discovered.

**Keep in oldtools:** May be useful if similar issues happen again, but shouldn't be needed for normal operations.

**What it does:**
- Tests `generateUserCode()` function
- Simulates auth0-events.mjs flow
- Identifies index conflicts

**Historical use:** Discovered the `code_1` index conflict issue.

**Keep in oldtools:** Good diagnostic tool but not needed for day-to-day operations.
