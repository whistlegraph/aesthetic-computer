# Moods Bi-Directional Sync - Implementation Complete ✅

**Date:** 2025-10-14

## Summary

Successfully implemented bi-directional sync between MongoDB and ATProto for aesthetic.computer moods, including migration of existing data and cleanup of duplicates.

## What Was Done

### 1. **Dual-Write Implementation** ✅
- Created `mood-atproto.mjs` helper module with sync functions
- Updated `mood.mjs` Netlify function to write to both MongoDB and ATProto
- Added error handling (ATProto failures don't block mood creation)
- MongoDB updated with `atproto.rkey` after successful ATProto sync

### 2. **Migration & Sync** ✅
- Created `sync-mongodb-from-atproto.mjs` to sync existing ATProto records back to MongoDB
- Migrated all 222 @jeffrey moods successfully
- MongoDB now has `atproto: { rkey }` field for all moods
- ATProto has `mongoId` field for all moods

### 3. **Duplicate Cleanup** ✅
- Found and deleted 140 duplicate ATProto records (from interrupted migration)
- Kept only the records referenced by MongoDB
- Verified: 222 moods in both systems, no duplicates

## Current State

### MongoDB Schema
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  user: "auth0|...",
  mood: "text content",
  when: ISODate("..."),
  atproto: {
    rkey: "3m36qcr3bg22g"  // 13 bytes reference to ATProto record
  }
}
```

### ATProto Schema (computer.aesthetic.mood)
```javascript
{
  $type: "computer.aesthetic.mood",
  mood: "text content",     // max 5000 chars
  when: "2025-10-09T...",   // ISO 8601
  mongoId: "68e8064c..."    // reference to MongoDB _id
}
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `/system/backend/mood-atproto.mjs` - ATProto sync helper functions
- `/system/backend/sync-mongodb-from-atproto.mjs` - Sync MongoDB from existing ATProto records
- `/system/backend/delete-atproto-duplicates.mjs` - Clean up duplicate ATProto records
- `/at/scripts/check-mood-sync.mjs` - Verify MongoDB sync status
- `/at/scripts/check-atproto-moods.mjs` - Query ATProto PDS for moods
- `/at/scripts/check-atproto-duplicates.mjs` - Detect duplicate ATProto records

### Modified Files
- `/system/netlify/functions/mood.mjs` - Added dual-write logic in POST handler

## Migration Results - @jeffrey

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total MongoDB moods | 222 |
| Moods synced to ATProto | 222 |
| ATProto records (after cleanup) | 222 |
| Duplicates removed | 140 |

## How It Works

### New Mood Flow
1. User posts mood via API (`POST /api/mood`)
2. Mood inserted into MongoDB → gets `_id`
3. `createMoodOnAtproto()` called with mongoId
4. ATProto record created → returns `rkey`
5. MongoDB updated: `{ atproto: { rkey } }`
6. If ATProto fails: mood still saved in MongoDB, error logged

### Bi-Directional Sync Benefits
- **Fast lookups both ways**: MongoDB→ATProto and ATProto→MongoDB
- **Resilience**: Either system can rebuild from the other
- **Data integrity**: Cross-references validate consistency
- **Migration safety**: Can verify sync status anytime

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Test dual-write with a real mood post via web interface
2. Verify new mood appears on both MongoDB and ATProto

### Before Migrating Other Users
1. Test with 1-2 more users to validate process
2. Update `delete-erase-and-forget-me.mjs` to delete from ATProto
3. Consider rate limiting (ATProto may have API limits)

### Later
- [ ] Migrate remaining users' moods
- [ ] Add ATProto deletion to user account deletion
- [ ] Monitor dual-write success rate
- [ ] Consider batch sync job for any failed writes

## Scripts for Ongoing Maintenance

```bash
# Check sync status for a user
cd /workspaces/aesthetic-computer/at
node scripts/check-mood-sync.mjs <handle>

# Check ATProto moods
node scripts/check-atproto-moods.mjs <handle>

# Check for duplicates
node scripts/check-atproto-duplicates.mjs <handle>

# Sync MongoDB from ATProto (if needed)
cd /workspaces/aesthetic-computer/system
node backend/sync-mongodb-from-atproto.mjs <handle>

# Clean up duplicates
node backend/delete-atproto-duplicates.mjs <handle> --delete
```

## Technical Notes

### Why Minimal Nested Approach?
- Only stores `atproto.rkey` in MongoDB (13 bytes)
- Alternative (full ATProto URI, DID, etc.) would be 170+ bytes
- Keeps MongoDB documents lean
- Can reconstruct full URI: `at://${did}/computer.aesthetic.mood/${rkey}`

### Error Handling Strategy
- ATProto failures don't block MongoDB writes
- Ensures service availability even if ATProto is down
- Can backfill ATProto records later from MongoDB
- Logs errors for monitoring

### Script Exit Issues Fixed
- Added `process.exit(0)` to all scripts
- Previously hung due to open database connections
- Scripts now exit cleanly after completing

## Testing Checklist

- [x] MongoDB has all moods with `atproto.rkey`
- [x] ATProto has all moods with `mongoId`
- [x] No duplicate ATProto records
- [x] Scripts exit cleanly
- [ ] New mood via web interface creates both records
- [ ] ATProto failure doesn't break mood posting
- [ ] Second user migration works correctly
