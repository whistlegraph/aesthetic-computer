ac-pds
systemctl status pds
docker ps
docker logs pds
```

### Email Not Sending

Check SMTP configuration in `/pds/pds.env`:
```fish
ac-pds
grep SMTP /pds/pds.env
systemctl restart pds
```

### Spaces Connection Issues

```fish
ac-pds
grep BLOBSTORE /pds/pds.env
# Verify credentials match vault: ~/aesthetic-computer/aesthetic-computer-vault/at/deploy.env
```

## Backup & Recovery

### Manual Backup

```fish
ac-pds
/pds/pds-backup.sh
# Backups stored in: pds-blobs-aesthetic-computer/backups/
```

### Restore from Backup

```fish
ac-pds
# Stop PDS
systemctl stop pds

# Restore databases
aws s3 cp s3://pds-blobs-aesthetic-computer/backups/latest/accounts.sqlite /pds/
aws s3 cp s3://pds-blobs-aesthetic-computer/backups/latest/pds.sqlite /pds/

# Restart
systemctl start pds
```

## Security

- SSH access via key authentication only (`~/.ssh/aesthetic_pds`)
- Firewall configured for ports 22, 80, 443 only

## Monitoring

### Health Check Script

Located at: `/at/pds/scripts/health-check.sh`

```fish
cd /workspaces/aesthetic-computer/at/pds/scripts
bash health-check.sh
```

### Metrics to Watch

- Disk usage: `df -h` on server
- Memory: `free -h`
- Docker status: `docker stats pds`
- Log size: `du -sh /pds/*.log`
