*** Alex Investor Notes ***
  - Why is this gonna be a social phenomenon?
  - How will this spread virally?
  - Why will people share this with one another?
  - Why will people keep using it?
  
  - Other people can't do this - I'm in this position and put the pieces together.
  - Non-obvious insight in culture or consumer behavior & technology.
  - How does this make people great?
  - Feel out the person I'm talking to.
  - Cannot be mischaracterized as an artistic curiosity.  (80% bad / 20% good)
  - Know who people are and adjust accordingly.
  - First minute is 90% of the pitch.
  - Look at what investors have done in the past...
  - Tabula Rasa
  - Don't prioritize VR failed investors.
  - Make a spreadsheet.
