!! what to improve in this video:

1. add subtitles for everything you say (using a consistent type)

2. hold quick appearances / thought bubble type longer so
   people can actually read it

3. consider adding a cute little click or pop sound / mouth when your
   type appears / disappears?

4. consider adding / making ambient music (that is youtube safe)
   and attenuating excessive wind sounds

5. consider voiceover + montage as primary storytelling driver
  - with diagetic audio as secondary + special (where you face the camera and speak)

6. why no pilates footage / footage of other people entering / leaving?
   (if you're gonna capture ur environment... get the major plot points)

7. don't forget to introduce your friends / don't put them on a background layer
   (spend a bit of time on them)

!! thoughts for new videos

consider simpler more formal narratives like...
  - eat twenty grapes, each with a typographic thought that appears.
  - examining hair oil (with typographic thoughts)
