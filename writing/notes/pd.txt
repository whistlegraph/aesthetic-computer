⚾️ Company purpose
  - Define your company in a single declarative sentence. This is harder than it
    looks. It’s easy to get caught up listing features instead of communicating
    your mission.

❌ Problem 
  - Describe the pain of your customer. How is this addressed today and what are
    the shortcomings to current solutions.

✅ Solution 
  - Explain your eureka moment. Why is your value prop unique and compelling? Why
    will it endure? And where does it go from here?

⏳ Why now? 
  - The best companies almost always have a clear why now? Nature hates a
    vacuum—so why hasn’t your solution been built before now?

📊 Market potential 
  - Identify your customer and your market. Some of the best companies invent
    their own markets.

🍖 Competition / alternatives 
  - Who are your direct and indirect competitors. Show that you have a
    plan to win.

🧩 Business model 
  - How do you intend to thrive?

🏟️ Team 
  - Tell the story of your founders and key team members.

💸 Financials 
  - If you have any, please include.

 🛝 Vision 
  - If all goes well, what will you have built in five years?
