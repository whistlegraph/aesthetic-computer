*** Ideas ***
(Old ones from README on 23.02.10.18.57)

Rewrite my old Python `Diary` program.
  - Mint diary entries.

Remake Shrub

Improve documentation.
  - In console when the whole thing opens.
  - Have a global keyboard shortcut to spit documentation to console... for each
    function!
  - Get jsDocs working: https://jsdoc.app/about-configuring-jsdoc.html

Development Improvements
  Would the best way to produce a scripting language be by making a fully
  curry-able system or some domain specific languages using `` then
  combining them?
  -- See here for a notation example of inline s-expressions: https://hag.codes

  Could an editing session or new disk be started from the prompt? Maybe it
  could load a GitHub codespace?

  - How to make use of xterm.js? Could it be used for this project or not...

  Implement drawing / gesture based disk launchers from the prompt.

  Take over right click so no context menu shows up.

  Ink types? ... can they be procedural using a buffer?

  What would a build script for releasing a single disk or
  stack of disks look like?

    1. Make a new directory D for the build.
    2. Copy a subset of /disks/public to D/disks
    3. Copy index.html, style.css, boot-rolled.js and /computer to D.
    4. Modify boot-rolled.js to start loading from the first listed disk.
    5. Generate metadata.json for the work.
    6. Zip and upload to fxHash or put whole directory into Pinata.
    7. Test to make sure everything works.
    8. Mint on a contract (or Cancel and remove files from IPFS).

  What would a full system / suite release look like?

    Using the build script with a set of chosen disks where the main
    disk is a shell interface.

    Document the API by generating the commands inside a disk and print
    them to the console using keyboard shortcuts.

    - [] Generate full API docs in the prompt disk.

  Make my first generative disk / piece and mint it.
    - Test it in Chrome / Safari / and Firefox.
    - In larger multi-disk IPFS exports, a new root path must be defined other
      than `prompt`. See disk.js `load` function.

  Make a quick fullscreen button (make a new keyboard input module).

  Fix Firefox: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1247687

  Add a new deployment scheme that actually allows my websocket server to
  function... this might mean leaving behind Vercel or configuring it
  for different directories in my repository, running separate server code
  for sockets.

  Add syntax notification of some kind for disk files, using a comment at
  the top. This would eventually allow me to completely
  change from JavaScript.

  Add stochastic syntax / DSL for basic drawing?
  Example: wipe.ink.line.line.line.ink("red").box;

  What cryptocurrency / web3.js lib would I hook an editor up to
  for minting, uploading edition data, etc?

  Make a video-recording app that generates 3 letter codes? - to augment
  my hand-written notes and pages.

  Add ability to define the logical / simulation framerate.

  Give myself the ability to automate testing of system using "robot".

  Write a simple note taking program with saving and loading of drawings
  and also recording and playback?
