Two Balls: for a Wilson and N Players 

0. Wilson stands outside quad.
1. Place B1 in center of quad.
2. Players gather around the ball.
3. Start dribbling B2 rhythmically.
4. Players walk the edges accordingly.
5. Pause, spin B2 in air and catch.
  - a. Speak word under primary index finger.
  - b. If no word then continue dribbling. 
6. Players interpret word synchronously.
7. If "Wilson" is called, players compete for B1.
8. Winner becomes the Wilson after singing.
   "Round the quad we wilson ball
    where all the strips have different calls"
9. Repeat from 0 with new Wilson.

Current issues - any Wilson can dribble for an indeterminate
                 duration and the game will not progress.
