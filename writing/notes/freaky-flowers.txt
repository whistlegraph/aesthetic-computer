1. Please introduce yourself and your work in three or fewer sentences
  - Hi my name is Jeffrey Alan Scudder and I'm an artist who makes software and loves to draw. Freaky Flowers was made
    in my own software called "Wand", running in my own computing environment, aesthetic.computer! I believe that computing
    interfaces should be design to fulfill the human spirit, which is why I've focused on
    hands-on artmaking tools and media inventions throughout my career. I create art in order
    to fund and sustain this mission, and also to express my inner feelings, which... otherwise come out so rarely.

2. 4 things we should know about your collection
  - Every Freaky Flower starts off with your average Chromie Squiggle. Then, I completely freak out! (In a controlled, formalistic sense.) 
  - Some pieces contain red banner messages from me personally. These comprise aesthetic.computer's mission statement at the moment.
  - Each work was recorded at my home in Ashland, OR, switching between a Meta Quest Pro and a Meta Quest 2 in order to
    draw continously without waiting for batteries to charge.
  - There is a puzzle inside of this series. The answer is a seed phrase. The grail is Token 0! 

3. Speak a little to the evolution of your collection from start to finish
  - Images come easy with me. When I need to make a bunch of watercolors or
    fill a skecthbook that is no problem. I can draw forever. Programming is very hard though.  
    I try to do the most difficult things in my life because I believe those things
    will advance my field as a whole. As a painter who learned to program... my journey
    has been one of sacrificing the joy of endlessly drawing with ease, for the pain
    of advancing the tools of my trade. The images, jokes, feelings and references
    within Freaky Flowers flowed out like a breath of air, but the tooling was hard to swallow.
    I barely slept once I started drawing, because I felt so accomplished
    that my tool was finally working. (When I was little I would fantasize about being a Jedi
    and the journey of constructing my own lightsaber.)

4. Where does the uniqueness of your work show up for your viewers? for yourself?
  - I have thought about this more and more over the years of receiving comments on my drawings. In short,
    my hand is very well practiced. I have created, observed, and produced endless amounts of gestures in my life. 
    I love to find and make beautiful marks. I do that in my whistlegraphs, my digital paintings...
    I do that in my code with the keys I type, and I did that in "Wand" on my headset with Freaky Flowers just the same.
    In college I would always tell myself to just draw more pictures than anyone
    else because I believed that the longterm investment would produce a unique hand.  

5. Can you share some of your inspiration for this collection? Was it always that
   or did you find some of that inspiration through the creative process?
   - I always find my inspiration in the creative process. I never have any idea what the content
     of my work will wrap itself in. Usually it begins with tools. Here's what happens: I'll buy a sketchbook
     and a set of crayons, or a fountain pen... or a Wacom tablet. (In this case, it was a Meta headset.)
     I'll start using that tool and fall in love with it so much that I decide to "develop" something
     conceptual on top of that. These inventions come from my love of interacting with things, performing,
     and playing with affordances. The computer has always fascinated me because if you are willing to 
     do something incredibly difficult (learning to code well) then you gain a type of power
     as an artist that in my opinion puts you into an entirely new plane of aesthetic understanding and agency.

6. What are some of the benefits (tangible and / or intangible) holders get by owning a piece of your collection?
  - Freaky Flowers are standard, untextured triangular meshes (models) that collectors can keep far into the future of spatial computing.
  - Each one is also a simple durational recording, which can be played back at different rates and even reinterpreted in future software editions (amazing for preservation).
  - They can be viewed on collector's VR headsets, or in their browsers.
  - You can quickly access a Freaky Flower at any time by visiting aesthetic.computer and typing "freaky-flower #" (or "ff #").
  - You can take stills or save the mesh (GLB) file and speed up or slow down the recording all from within each piece!
  - The entire "Freaky Flowers" project can be watched in order persistently, starting from Token 0. This allows viewers
    to ambiently experience the entire collection in one setting from any visual angle! 

7. Can you speak a little to the rarity traits of your pieces and how you came up with those variations?
  - I wanted to be fun and playful with my rarity traits, but I didn't want to be unrealistic so I chose cultural idioms.
  - Many Freaky Flowers have no labels, but some are simply "Basic", whereas others might be "Base".
  - One of them is so incredibly cute that it is considered a "Master" "UWU".
  - Others are tragically "Dead" and some are unfortunately just an "Error".
  - Some attributes are PURELY :) formal, like "Zebra", "RGB", "Wireframe" and "No Clip".
  - Look for the "Clue" attribute. It's an easy doorway to the puzzle!
  - Token 128 is an "Ultimate" "Squiggle Destroyer". It is guaranteed to completely destroy any Chromie Squiggle in any future auction. 

8. One thing people might be surprised by about what went into creating this?
  - Haha so I finished my code in a frenzy after a few endless workdays, took one shower, and had visions of an NFT collection that was, autographic, typographic, and full of gestural energy.
  - In the same shower I realized how miopic that autobiographic interest was and so I thought of a trojan horse style shell of an internet aesthetic I could
    use to entertain audiences who are familiar with NFTs while still embedding my personal message that is both serious and (almost 100%) sincere. 

9. Go-to playlist / song while you’re working
  The visual moods of Freaky Flowers have been acoustically tuned by:
  
  - Brian and Roger Eno (Mixing Colours) 
  - Lemon Demon - Cabinet Man
  - Yung Goth (Top Algorithmic Tracks)
  - Megabyte (Powerplay)
  - PC Music, Vols 1-3 (Mostly Volume 2, mostly Broken Flowers on repeat!)

  The music I listen to while actually making pictures is usually a tool to get me into
  a certain character... get my hand and vision working a certain way.

10. What’s something unique or surprising about you (as a person / artist) that readers might not know?
  - I actually took a pretty serious break from writing software based artwork for the last few years to create Whistlegraph, which
    is a TikTok account and company I own with my two partners Camille and Alex. We've been pretty successful at making
    both a cultural and educational impact using the most basic of tools and a LOT of playful engineering and creativity. 

11. Share a fun fact (outside of your collection) that would make readers smile.
  - I am planning to use Freaky Flowers as part of my next Y Combinator application, which I've still never gotten into even though
    Paul Graham wrote that seminal Hackers and Painters essay and I have been a daily HN reader for over 10 years now! Just wanna be noticed here.

12. Who is someone famous, living or historical, that you would love to see collect your work, why?
  - I am still a relatively new market artist. I don't have desires in terms of who my collectors are and am very happy
    that many artists who have believed in and helped grow this freaky flower of a practice I have into existence
    are now also in the market and have collected my work to continue to support me. I hope that my work can now reach
    outside my art circles into the corners of Silicon Valley where my message will have the biggest impact and I can
    find deeper support for my inventions. 

13. Any special rituals while you were creating your collection? Music you listened to, beverage of choice? 
  - In order to finish this collection and complete my software I survived on a hacked psycho-somatic reward system consisting
    mainly of a large feast every 24 hours decorated by Noble coffee pour-overs (around the corner from my house)
    short hits of THC between commits, and TONS of glasses of water from my charcoal Berkey filter which sits right next to my PC!
