* (Outdated) Bugs / Improvements
  - Stop sending duplicate event data for "draw" and "touch" in `pen`.

  - Explore: removing: send({ type: "update", content: { didntRender: true, loading } });
  From the bottom of `disk.js`.
  - Add blockchain integration for identity: https://docs.moralis.io/introduction/readme
  - Re-work the depth buffer (in the rasterizer) before making a simple 3D environment?
  - Pass 'diskTime' global into the api.
  - Add $api.sound.beatCount counter to `beat`.
  - Add scriptProcessorNode fallback so audio can run within insecure contexts. (FigJam)
  - Stop tracks in all mediaStreams: https://stackoverflow.com/a/12436772
  (Video and Microphone)
  - Refactor (screen.width -> screen.w & screen.height -> screen.h) across the board?
    - To be more consistent with `graph.box`.
  - Workers can be wrapped in this... https://benohead.com/blog/2017/12/06/cross-domain-cross-browser-web-workers/

*** 🎃 DIGITPAIN ***
 - [] Complete DIGITPAIN 0-5.
 - [] Mint the work and have the contract made.
 - [] Make a frame capture tool for generating webp images.
 - [] Add the work to the JSON and release digitpain.com.
 - [] Write a better static exporter script includes only the disks I want, plus resources.
     - [] Automate DIGITPAIN (Teia) exports:
            1. Clone `public` directory.
            2. Remove any `.html` files that aren't `digitpain-ipfs-index.html`.
            3. Process `digitpain-ipfs-index.html`, inserting info for a new mint.
            4. Rename `digitpain-ipfs-index.html` to `index.html`.
            3. Remove all files other than `/digitpain` and `digitpain0.js` from `disks/`.
            4. Zip the contents so there is a zip file with one directory called `public`,
               and rename it to `DIGITPAIN #.zip`.

***Routing Longtail***
  - [x] Do away with hashtag routes entirely.
  - [x] Refactor ":" parameter encoding (see `wg`) into using classic url parameters.

        aesthetic.computer/wg_fuzz
        aesthetic.computer/wg-fuzz
        aesthetic.computer/wg~fuzz
        aesthetic.computer/metronome~80~100
  
        aesthetic.computer/~niki/plot~40~50
        aesthetic.computer/~niki/plot~40~50
  
        // Maybe the special characters could be default parameters, or represent
        // types of some kind?
  
        Available domains:
          - prompt.ac
