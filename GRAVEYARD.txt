            2. Remove any `.html` files that aren't `digitpain-ipfs-index.html`.
            3. Process `digitpain-ipfs-index.html`, inserting info for a new mint.

               and rename it to `DIGITPAIN #.zip`.

***Routing Longtail***

        aesthetic.computer/wg-fuzz
        aesthetic.computer/wg~fuzz

        aesthetic.computer/~niki/plot~40~50
        aesthetic.computer/~niki/plot~40~50
  
        // Maybe the special characters could be default parameters, or represent
        // types of some kind?
  
        Available domains:
          - prompt.ac

  - [x] Add hex support to color inputs.

*** Bonus ***
  - [x] Change `ap` -> `test`. (Rapter)
  - [x] Detect dark mode and modify the prompt accordingly.

*** 3D Renderering ***
  + Done
    - [x] Only load threejs if necessary.
    - [x] Fix thread boundary conditions related to hot reloading.
    - [x] Broken on load.
      - [x] Fix `sim` being busted on quick reload.
    - [x] Fix cursor transparency in 3dline.
         (Make blend function take into account existing alpha.)
    - [x] See if this is faster than the software renderer as-is?
    - [x] Make sure picture ratios match up perfectly.
    - [x] Get lines working.
    - [x] Switch the / convert software rasterizer from left handed to right handed
      rendering.
      What worked on the software renderer side:
       - Flip X and Z position of each vertex before transform.
       - Flip X and Z rotation of each vertex before transform.
       - Flip Y rotation of the camera before transform.
       - Rotation matrix multiply order for camera: YXZ.
       - Rotation matrix multiply order for vertices: XYZ.
      + Future + Eventually I could look into using the exact same matrix data across both?
    - [x] Get textures in there.
    - [x] Enable all objects.
    - [x] Optimize pixel array sending. (Had to make an extra layer)
    - [x] Disable backface culling.
    - [x] Make it so that "form" calls that take an array, render in 3js and return the pixels back.
    - [x] A single "form" call should be able to send over multiple objects.

 *** Resize (gap-density) ***
   - [x] Add "scale" to "paste"
   - [x] Cursor is janky when paint returns -> false.

*** Prompt ***
- [x] Use localStorage for command history.
  - [x] Set up general localStorage system / API.
  - [x] Maybe it could be built off of store?

*** Pieces: Prompt ***
 - [x] No more tildes for user paths...
      Instead, use an '@' for usernames.
      eg. sage/piece
  - [x] Prompt
  - [x] Index
 - [x] Up arrow for previous command. 
 - [x] Update MOTD. 

*** Safari Day ***
- [-] Thin lines appearing from `gap` and no gap in mobile Safari.
- [x] Grey selection bubble appears in mobile Safari.
- [x] Loading spinner not appearing in mobile Safari. 
- [x] Fix iOS Safari page refresh bug. (Test on MacBook Pro)
  (Needed `Vary: *` http header, to prevent Safari's cache from bugging out
  on the SharedArrayBuffer / isolatedOrigin CORS headers.)

***Tracker, Pull***
- [x] Fix interface boxes.
- [x] Make `boxes` test piece.

***Meta***
- [x] Add support for custom / locally generated thumbnail overrides.
  - [x] Test override for some specific route... maybe blank?
- [x] Serve a 404 page for anything else that breaks.
  - [x] Right now it just crashes here: https://aesthetic.computer/okok
  - [x] Right now it just is black here: https://aesthetic.computer/~niki/whatever
- [x] Do the TOML routes actually matter? No.
- [x] Get ~/niki/blank working again.
- [x] Separate out / parse the text before loading a disk serverside so that
      parameterized disks work again.
- [x] Make them work on iOS
- [x] Write a new netlify function that returns the proper html for every page,
      so that prerendering can be turned off (get imessage previews working).
- [x] Should og:image and twitter:image have file extensions?

***L8 Night***
- [x] Get a debugger working. 

***2D Drawing Primitives for Niki***
 - [x] line from point... at angle with distance
 
***Routing & Twitter Cards***
 - [X] Figure out how to get open-graph info and twitter cards working for all of a.c?
      - [X] How should the og:images be made? Perhaps a special tool is needed or screenshots
           can be taken automatically?
      - [x] Set defaults if the info isn't there...
- [x] Test Netlify pre-rendering to see if it functions.
- [x] Use netlify's pre-rendering and (it's already turned on... and change the og:title)
- [X] Enable Netlify pre-rendering.
       - Validator: https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator
       - Prototype: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/pepper-efficacious-yellowhorn?path=index.html
 - [X] Implement path based routing for pieces via netlify and on a local dev server.

***User Pieces (niki.aesthetic.computer)***
- [x] History breaks right now across domains, because some parsing goes through the `prompt`.
  - [x] Make sure loading using the `tilde` key works across hosts.
  - [x] Start remote routing from boot instead of only in prompt?
      - [x] Make a `parse.js` library file that can be used in `prompt`, then `boot`.
      - [x] Copy the code from prompt and replicate it in boot, then
      - [x] follow the logic through to check for inconsistencies.
      - [x] Remove `search` from `disk.js` load. (Deprecrate reading queryParams
        at the disk level... they should only be reserved for system settings?)
- [x] Also, the page can't refresh and the path gets rewritten improperly. 
- [x] Get `niki.aesthetic.computer` running.
- [x] Get a prototype of Niki's piece working that she can actually edit as the first user.

***Server Re-organization***
 - [x] Should the uploader be a serverless function? Yes!
      (This would prevent the need for a load balancer if file uploading was a bottleneck.)
      (Would it run locally?)
 - [x] Set netlify environment variables for the digital ocean space.
 - [x] How to run two server processes from one npm command?
 - [x] Should the websocket server run as a separate process from the http api?
 - [x] Should it run on a separate machine as of now?

***Editor***
- [-] Get socket server running under GitHub codespaces as well.
  (wss:// is currently unsupported)
- [x] Get the project working in GitHub codespaces.

🐛 Completed Bugs & Regressions
- [X] Check to see why custom thumbnails are broken for remote URL disks.
- [X] `wg` disks no longer work 
- [X] Kill any microphone (or video) connection after leaving a piece it's connected to.
- [X] Routing: Check ~tilde~ key - don't push duplicate states in the history.
