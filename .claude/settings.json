During\nrapid reframes \\(e.g., mobile scrolling\\), the canvas size changes faster\nthan the worker can provide new pixels, causing black flashes.\n\nChanges:\n- Guard WebGL/WebGPU canvas visibility with dimension mismatch check\n- Skip canvas pixel recovery when awaiting reframe pixels\n- Keep freeze frame visible until matching pixels are received\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n\\)\")",
