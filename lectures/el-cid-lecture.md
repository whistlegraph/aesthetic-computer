## 🎯 OPENING 
*5 minutes*

### Hook & Core Concept

> **"What if your phone could be a musical instrument for making art and code?"**

**What Aesthetic Computer is:**  
A mobile-first runtime and social network for creative computing

**The Musical Instrument Metaphor:**  
Interface designed like an instrument where users:
- 🎵 Discover "memorizable paths" through command sequences
- 🎼 Build "performable repertoires" of creative techniques  
- 🎹 Improvise and recombine learned patterns

**Timeline:**  
Started April 2021 → evolved from No Paint (2020 viral success) → 3+ years of development

**Live Demo Setup:**  
`aesthetic.computer` → activate prompt → try `notepat`

## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURAL INNOVATION
*8 minutes*

### Revolutionary Design Principles

#### 🧩 PIECES not APPS
Every program is a lightweight "piece" with instant URL addressability

```
aesthetic.computer/notepat
aesthetic.computer/paint  
aesthetic.computer/chat
```

✅ Instant loading, no app stores, works universally across devices

#### 💬 Prompt-Driven Navigation  
Single unified command interface for all functionality

```bash
> list                    # Discover all pieces
> notepat                # Launch tone matrix
> [Esc] [`] [Backspace]  # Return to prompt
```

#### 📱 Mobile-First Design  
Touch-optimized interface, seamless across phones/tablets/desktop

#### 🌐 Browser-Native  
Zero downloads, installations, or dependencies - pure web technology
