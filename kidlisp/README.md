# KidLisp

KidLisp is a minimal Lisp dialect designed for creating generative art and interactive experiences within the Aesthetic Computer system. It provides a simple yet powerful language for expressing visual and temporal patterns.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Running KidLisp
KidLisp pieces are executed within the Aesthetic Computer environment. The main entry point is through the `kidlisp.mjs` evaluator.

### Analyzing Pieces
Use the tools in `kidlisp/tools/` to analyze existing pieces:

```bash
# Analyze structure and performance
./kidlisp/tools/source-tree.mjs $cow

# Get raw source code
./kidlisp/tools/get-source.mjs $ican
```

Both tools require the dev server to be running (`npm run dev`) as they connect to the local KidLisp storage API.

## üìñ Language Reference

### Basic Syntax
KidLisp uses S-expressions (parentheses-based syntax):
```lisp
(function arg1 arg2 ...)
```

### Core Functions
The evaluator in `kidlisp.mjs` implements a comprehensive set of **118 functions** across 12 categories:

- **Graphics**: `wipe`, `ink`, `line`, `box`, `circle`, `tri`, `plot`, `flood`, `shape`
- **Transformations**: `zoom`, `scroll`, `spin`, `blur`, `contrast` - 11 pixel-level effects
- **Math**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `sin`, `cos`, `random`, `wiggle` - 14 mathematical operations  
- **3D Graphics**: `cube`, `form`, `trans` - 8 three-dimensional functions
- **Audio**: `mic`, `melody`, `overtone` - 6 sound processing functions
- **System**: `width`, `height`, `frame`, `clock`, `fps` - 9 system properties
- **Colors**: All CSS colors plus `rainbow`, `zebra` - 19 color functions
- **Control**: `def`, `later`, `if`, `once`, `repeat` - 7 language constructs

#### Graphics & Transformations
KidLisp provides 11 pixel-level transformation functions:

- **`(scroll x y)`** - Translation with wrapping  
- **`(zoom factor)`** - Scale transformation with accumulation
- **`(spin angle)`** - Rotation around screen center
- **`(blur amount)`** - Gaussian blur effect
- **`(contrast level)`** - Contrast adjustment
- **`(blur amount)`** - Gaussian blur effect

Examples:
```lisp
(scroll 5 0)        ; Move right by 5 pixels
(zoom 1.1)          ; Gradual zoom in
(spin 1)            ; Slow rotation
(blur 2)            ; Soft blur effect
```

*For a complete API reference with all 118 functions, see [`COMPLETE_API_MAP.md`](COMPLETE_API_MAP.md).*

*For detailed transformation documentation, see [`docs/suck-complete-technical-guide.md`](docs/suck-complete-technical-guide.md).*

## üîß Architecture

### Evaluator (`kidlisp.mjs`)
The main evaluator is a tree-walking interpreter that:
- Parses S-expressions into an AST
- Maintains execution context and variable bindings
- Provides built-in functions for graphics and interaction
- Handles embedded piece loading and execution
- Manages performance optimization for real-time rendering

### Storage Backend (`store-kidlisp.mjs`)
The storage system provides:
- **POST** - Store new KidLisp pieces
- **GET `?code=nanoid`** - Retrieve single piece by ID
- **GET `?codes=id1,id2,id3`** - Batch retrieve multiple pieces
- Persistent storage with nanoid-based addressing

### Embedding System
KidLisp supports embedding other pieces as layers:
```lisp
($other-piece-id arg1 arg2)
```
This enables composition and reusability while maintaining performance through caching.

## üîÑ Transformation Functions

KidLisp includes 11 transformation functions for pixel manipulation:

| Function | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `scroll` | Move pixels with wrapping | `(scroll 5 0)` |
| `zoom` | Scale from center | `(zoom 1.1)` |
| `spin` | Rotate canvas | `(spin 1)` |
| `blur` | Gaussian blur | `(blur 2)` |
| `contrast` | Adjust contrast | `(contrast 1.5)` |
| `suck` | Radial displacement | `(suck 0.5)` |
| `pan` | Camera movement | `(pan 10 5)` |
| `sort` | Sort pixels by brightness | `(sort)` |
| `resetSpin` | Reset rotation | `(resetSpin)` |
| `smoothspin` | Smooth rotation | `(smoothspin 0.1)` |
| `unpan` | Reset camera | `(unpan)` |

```lisp
; Basic transformation examples
(scroll 5 0)        ; Move right by 5 pixels
(zoom 1.1)          ; Gradual zoom in
(spin 1)            ; Slow rotation
(blur 2)            ; Soft blur effect
(suck 0.5)          ; Radial displacement
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Tools
The `kidlisp/tools/` directory contains utilities for:
- **Source Analysis** - Understanding piece structure and dependencies
- **Performance Profiling** - Identifying expensive operations
- **Debugging** - Inspecting piece execution

### Testing
Run the test suite to validate evaluator behavior:
```bash
# TODO: Add test runner instructions
```

### Contributing
When modifying the evaluator:
1. Test with existing pieces to ensure compatibility
2. Update this documentation for new features
3. Add examples for new language constructs
4. For new transformation functions, follow the established patterns:
   - Add to `graph.mjs` with mask support and wrapping behavior
   - Add to `kidlisp.mjs` with deferred execution support
   - Include in embedded layer special function lists
   - Test with both immediate and deferred execution contexts

**Recent Additions (2025-09-06):**
- Complete documentation organization with 118-function API map
- Development tools for API analysis and function discovery
