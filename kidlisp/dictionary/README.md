# 📚 KidLisp Dictionary

*Comprehensive API documentation organized by concept*

## 🎯 What is the Dictionary?

The KidLisp Dictionary organizes all 118 functions into logical, concept-based groupings. Instead of hunting through alphabetical lists, you can explore by the type of creative work you want to do.

## 🗺️ Navigation by Concept

### 🎨 Visual Creation
- **[🌈 Color](color.md)** - CSS colors, gradients, effects (140+ dynamic functions)
- **[🎯 Drawing](drawing.md)** - Lines, shapes, primitives, pixels
- **[🌪️ Transformations](transformations.md)** - Scroll, zoom, spin, blur, suck effects  
- **[🖼️ Canvas](canvas.md)** - Screen setup, resolution, masking
- **[🖼️ Images](images.md)** - Loading, pasting, stamping, copying
- **[✍️ Text](text.md)** - Typography, labels, text rendering

### 🎵 Audio & Media
- **[🎵 Audio](audio.md)** - Microphone, melody, noise, amplitude
- **[🎮 3D Graphics](3d.md)** - Cubes, forms, camera control

### 🧮 Programming Fundamentals  
- **[🧮 Math](math.md)** - Arithmetic, trigonometry, random numbers
- **[🔀 Control Flow](control-flow.md)** - Functions, conditionals, special forms
- **[📊 Data](data.md)** - System properties, manipulation, caching
- **[⏰ Timing](timing.md)** - Frames, clocks, delays, fps

### 🎮 Interaction & System
- **[🎮 Input](input.md)** - Touch, tap, gesture handling
- **[🧭 Navigation](navigation.md)** - Jumping between pieces, embedding
- **[🔧 Debugging](debugging.md)** - Logging, inspection, development tools
- **[🛠️ Utilities](utilities.md)** - Miscellaneous helper functions

## 🎨 Getting Started Paths

### **"I want to draw things"**
Start with [Drawing](drawing.md) → [Color](color.md) → [Transformations](transformations.md)

### **"I want to make interactive art"** 
Start with [Input](input.md) → [Drawing](drawing.md) → [Control Flow](control-flow.md)

### **"I want to create animations"**
Start with [Timing](timing.md) → [Transformations](transformations.md) → [Math](math.md)

### **"I want to work with sound"**
Start with [Audio](audio.md) → [Math](math.md) → [Timing](timing.md)

### **"I want to make 3D graphics"**
Start with [3D Graphics](3d.md) → [Math](math.md) → [Timing](timing.md)

## 🎯 Function Coverage

| Concept | Functions | Status |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Color | ~145 (CSS + effects) | 📋 Planned |
| Drawing | 9 core primitives | 📋 Planned |
| Transformations | 11 pixel effects | 📋 Planned |
| Math | 14 operations | 📋 Planned |
| Control Flow | 7 language constructs | 📋 Planned |
| Canvas | 5 screen functions | 📋 Planned |
| Images | 5 image operations | 📋 Planned |
| Audio | 6 sound functions | 📋 Planned |
| 3D Graphics | 16 3D functions | 📋 Planned |
| Data | 8 system properties | 📋 Planned |
| Input | 1 interaction function | 📋 Planned |
| Timing | 4 temporal functions | 📋 Planned |
| Text | 3 typography functions | 📋 Planned |
| Debugging | 4 development tools | 📋 Planned |
| Navigation | 3 system functions | 📋 Planned |
| Utilities | 4 misc functions | 📋 Planned |

**Total: 118 functions across 16 conceptual areas**

## 🔍 Cross-Reference System

Functions often work together across concepts:
- **Color** + **Drawing** = Colorful shapes and lines
- **Math** + **Transformations** = Dynamic movement patterns  
- **Timing** + **Audio** = Rhythm and musical sequences
- **Input** + **Control Flow** = Interactive behavior
- **3D Graphics** + **Math** = Complex spatial relationships

Each dictionary page includes a "Related Concepts" section linking to complementary functionality.

## 🚀 Contributing

This dictionary is generated from the live KidLisp API and should be kept in sync with function implementations. See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for the complete implementation plan and progress tracking.

*The Dictionary approach makes KidLisp's 118 functions discoverable through creative intent rather than alphabetical searching. Start with what you want to create, not what you remember the function name to be.*
