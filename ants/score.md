# Ant Score Entry

This is the ant-local score entry point.

- Main score and task list source: `../SCORE.md`
- Ant mindset and rules source: `./mindset-and-rules.md`

Runtime note:
- `ants/colony.fish` composes both sources (ant mindset/rules first, then main score/tasks) when building the ant prompt.
