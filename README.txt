 üß© AESTHETIC.COMPUTER üß©

  A *new* computing environment that...

  (Technical Summary)
    - Works in updated web browsers on all major devices, including VR headsets! 
    - Runs "pieces" instead of "apps" or "programs".
    - Pieces are written in a proce55ing-inspired API that's fun to learn and fast
      to code in.
    - Screen defaults to an accessibly low resolution, great for learning
      and counting pixels with, but technically agnostic. (Choose your aesthetic!)
    - Batteries included with system tools and toys that emphasize creative activities
      with media content output.
      - Painting (line, smear, rect, @maya/tuesday, sparkle, [spray, pull])
      - Musicking (metronome, melody, tracker, microphone, bleep)
      - Sculpting (wand)
      - Writing (prompt, play)
      - Shooting (...)
      - Viewing & Listening (wg, ff, bgm)
    - Tools can be creatively strung together to form adaptive sequenced workflows
      for media creation, like Unix.

  (More Tech)
      - Threaded logic, audio, and rendering.
      - Low overhead hypervisor that runs one piece at a time.
        (similar to a disk based operating system)
      - Pieces can transition from one to another (instantly) without refreshing
        the page or losing context. 
      - Pieces can load remotely off any `https://` url so applications can be
        distributed over a network.
      - 2D/3D Software renderer for spatial display of programs as planes and
        ease of accessing pixels while coding a piece and learning graphics.
      - 3D WebGL renderer for VR.

üòÄ TODO üòÜ

üåü Projects in Progress (PIP) üåü

*** workshop with casey ***
  - [] Using `back()` should work consistently.
  - [] Publishing the same piece more than once / overwriting a piece doesn't
       work in the editor.
  - [] Multiple templates for different types of pieces.
    - [üü†] "Blank" piece template.
    - [] "3D" template.
    - [] "Networked" template.
    - [] "Character" template.
    - [x] "Brush" piece template.
  - [] Add param to `publish` to rename the file.
  - [] Overloaded functions and commands > different function names.
  - [] One should be able to view source code / use `source` from inside vscode.
    - [] Can this produce a new file tab inside of vscode?
    - [] So in order to draw from a template, you can say `new brush` or `new painting`.
  - [] Set "variable" names when using `done`, helpful for show and tell.

*** making things alive ***
  - [-] Pasting graphics in `field` is important.
  - [] Add `show` and `hide` for temporary show and tell.
  - [] Add `paste` for permanent bitmap pasting, maybe in
       a piece called `graf` that can be linked to from `field`?

*** load performance ***
  - [üü°] Spend a half day just on getting the site to load faster.

*** making the aliveness visible ***
  - [] Build a simple version of `log` now that we have list.

*** `world` <-> `painting` <-> piece integrations ***
  - [üçè] Share current painting in `world` using a `show` command.
  - [] Be able to easily complete a painting and then include it in a piece
      in a single line...
  - [] Maybe I could overload `paste` to include user strings...
  - [] Add the ability to name a painting so it can more
        easily be referenced, like for example in a `stamp @jeffrey/flower` tool.
        Or especially like old CS 1.5 sprays.
  - [] Should be able to say `done flower` to make the alias.
  - [] Also should be able to remove and change aliases.
  - [] Then a logged in user can `paste flower`.
  - [] There should be a command to set temporary names without persisting
        them to the network? Well... that's just empty `show` or maybe
        there could be a buffer of paintings in progress, similar to how
        text editors have buffers.
  - [] User world persistence with floating command notifications.
  - [] How to handle multiple handled users in the same room.
      (Make primary vs. a ghost type of view-only behavior?)
  - [] How to have two windows or machines up and use a put command while
      modifying pixels. (Always store current painting in the cloud for a registered user.)
  - [] Implement `paste` and send the pixels through the backend.
  + Done
  - [x] Add connection flash to world.

*** casting ***

*** API design ***
  - [] Whitelist some of the APIs for the docs and for usage in user pieces.
  - [] I guess this means it needs to load the api once whenever a user piece loads?
    - [] Screen user pieces for fetch requests. (Don't allow them.)
    - [] Write a great example / polish the pieces repo.
  - [] Can I programmatically use `api/doc` to whitelist the api
       if it's code running from a user piece and the `run` endpoint?
  + Done
  - [x] Build `docs` pages.
  - [x] Should it be called docs?
  - [x] Remove or deprecate the old `list` html design from `docs`?

      3. Use that code while entering parameters like `line CODE 255 255`
          (Pieces do not accept remote controlled parameters fail to load.) 
          - The piece needs to send a request to the server to join
            the slider's room.
      4. The slider can message the piece with a new value. 
      5. The piece can return other data, like color, for the slider.

        (Run a node server from `digitpain` directory that watches
         for file changes and sends a message from that server to the main
         server which will send a socket message to all clients to reload the
         file if `export const reload = true;`
   - [x] Set up a developers / "pieces" SSH server.
   - [x] Prototype live editing with SSH and live share?

***Audio + Video Storage (Microphone)***
  - [] Check to see if ffmpeg encoding can be skipped if the browser doesn't need to do it.
  - [] FFMPEG does not work offline: https://unpkg.com/@ffmpeg/core@0.10.0/dist/ffmpeg-core.js - https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm#why-it-doesnt-work-in-my-local-environment

 ***Upload Server***
   [] 1. Show the media (video) in a div overlay with a "Retry" or "Done" button.
     A. Retry - Removes the modal div and lets you re-record again.
     B. Done - Allows you to download the file immediately (if possible),
               and uploads it, giving you the code no matter what.
                               (The code page layout could be shared here.)
  
   [] 2. After the file uploads...
     A. You can also have the option to "Post" or "Publish?" which
     will make the work available as part of an ever-growing collection.
       - Idea: Posts are automatically minted to our wallet, but can optionally
               be minted to a poster's wallet if they decide to connect.
     B. Regardless, the file stored at the code will be deleted in 24 hours.

       - Inside of TikTok
         - Tell the user their video is ready and they can visit
           aesthetic.computer/CODE in a browser
           to download their video, which expires after 5 minutes.
  
           aesthetic.computer/microphone -> aesthetic.computer/dl.bn67gff5
           aesthetic.computer/get.dfcx4
  
           After recording in the microphone, you get this...
  
           aesthetic.computer/mic -> aesthetic.codes/bn67gff5
           ... or
           aesthetic.computer/mic -> codes.ac/bn67gff5
             (where codes.ac/bn67gff5 -> aesthetic.computer/codes.bn67gff5)
             (and the resource is stored at -> bin.aesthetic.computer/bn67gff5.ext)
                                               art.aesthetic.computer/...
  
           A pop-up that shows a QR code / a code to enter into aesthetic.codes.
           Upon visiting aesthetic.codes...
       - iOS or Android Mobile Browser or Desktop Browser
         - 1. Show a download button
       - in a native iOS app
         - let the user download the video immediately to their camera roll
       - Where do recordings / files get stored? What is the userflow...
         - Do they get stored at a special code, then users can
           go to the website / open another window and mint from the code
           or download it?
   - [] Look into categorizing uploaded objects with tags...
   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-tagging.html
   - [] And making use of user defined metadata in s3.
        These would be great for custom file properties likw
        what piece was used to make the art / object and what git commit
        of the project was used or something like that...
      
*** Pieces: Run&Gun ***

***Don't Go Upstairs***
  + Plans
    - An interactive story, told in multi-piece parts: https://twitter.com/digitpain/status/1567690125743919104/photo/1
    - This should serve as a test for fast-transitioning / preloading and
      sequencing pieces.
    - Use old Vectrex animation software as inspiration for the editors.
  + Now
    - Make a sub-directory for the pieces, and adjust the prompt so that
      if no file exists in the subdirectory then it checks an `index` file.

 *** Sage's Brush (@sage/hello_line) ***
  + Now
   *** Refactor: Density / Gap / Resize ***
     - [x] Remove the frameCount hack in sage's code.
     - [x] Deprecate both gap and density. Bake gap into resize.

  + Later
   *** API: Glaze ***
     - [] Add ability to update glaze uniforms via
         `glaze.params({uniform1: value, uni2: [0, 1, 2]});`
           function paint() {
             // user draw a dirty box that needs gpu processing as a tile larger than
             // the original pixel drawing
             glaze.params({
               crop: dirtyBox,
               samples: 12 // this dirtyBox will keep being glazed over for 12 frames
               uniform1: 1,
               uniform2: 2,
             });
             return dirtyBox;
           } 
     - [] Add "kiln" or "bake" function to bake in a glaze at the end of a
          nopaint buffer change.
     - [x] Be able to turn glaze on inside of remotely hosted pieces.

  *** Pressure ***
    - [] Get pen and finger working together.
        (When finger is drawing and pen is touched... is it recognized as pen?)
    - [] Pen: Get a good mapping for Apple Pencil / normalize the data. 
    - [] Touch: Two finger pressure. (Second finger regulates it via Y axis.)
    - [] Mouse: Use scroll wheel for delta. 

*** Re-organize Repository *** 
  - [] Make a better entry point for this repository, consider how far the
       monorepo idea should extend and make better room for text files, such as
       splitting up README.txt with PROJECTS.txt, WIP.txt, and GRAVEYARD.txt.

*** Publishing ***
  - [] How to have a default or custom thumbnail... even though things are randomly routed?

*** Refactoring ***
  - [] Clean up the use of "aesthetic.computer/disks/" across the whole project.
  - [] Refactor `wg` to make better use of thumbnails... what should the new structure be?

*** Favicons ***  
  - [] How should I generate favicons for each page or treat favicons in general?
   - Maybe just design a favicon? Should each piece also be able to have an icon?
   - Maybe the system could use these icons if pieces defined them...

***Terminal***
  - [] Make `function terminal()` to render to a text mode layer.

***JtoA***
  - [] Use web speech recognition API to make a program so that Artur and I can 
      communicate more complex thoughts.
      - https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/demos/speech.html
  Note: It's only gonna work in Safari on iOS. <https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=225298> (And if Dictation is enabled.)

***Spinline***
  - [] Circle algorithm with transparency, has doubly drawn pixels.
  - [] example: ink(255, 100).circle(x, y, 128);
  - [] Circle needs 'pan' support.
  - [] Make the regular circle small, and positioned at the tip of the rotating line.
  - [] No exported boot function does not show the mouse cursor...
  - [] Click and drag selection bug needs to be fixed on iOS. (Chrome + Safari)
  - [] Improve "density" function.

***Developers***
  - [] Add developer console log / catch errors and show them to users
       directly on the screen. Maybe this should be available all the time,
       even in production?
  - [] Catch errors better in the modules, so they can be easily deciphered
       from console messages.
  - [] Get it working on: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/niki-aesthetic-computer
  - [] Make an `edit` or `new` command to open an editor from the main page.

***View-Source***
  - [] Pressing 'Ctrl + `' should open the source code. - Document this in console.log of bios.
  - [] Typing `src` plus the `piece` should jump you to the github source page and these should also be url addressable.
  - [] Each page should print out its own description in the console.
   - [] Then all descriptions of existing pieces can be written.
   - [] Why are the disks located there in the first place?

***Readme***
  - [] Directly load the GitHub readme in a scrollable content window.
  - [] How could this tie into publishing a blog or devlog?

***i***
  - [] See `disks/i.mjs` 

***Shortcuts / open a new URL ***
  - [] Figure out notation: ~user/piece, piece~param1, #notion
    - [] Should this only be for `prompt` or should it also route URLs?
  - [] Make `manual` and `hq` load the notion (separate places) in a new tab.
  - [] Should the manual be a super.so site using one of the chosen typefaces?

***Prompt Start***
  - [] What info goes on the starting prompt page?
       Given that it can change every 60 seconds.
       And anyone who shares the link will see a preview image.
  - [] Short poem? Weekly poem?
  - [] Make the prompt start message easily editable by Niki.
    What would it mean for this message to use the ***Upload Server*** and merit
    a text editor.

***Prompt Updates***
  - [] ‚Äúsearch bar‚Äù any letter typed shows ‚Äúghost‚Äù letters of all possible options
  - [] Also make the commands case insensitive!

***Rooms***
  (WIP Notes)
  - Pieces can either be singleplayer or multiplayer, but rooms work everywhere!
  - All piece changes are global. People can only be in one piece at a time together.
  - Start a room with other people and their mouse cursors / fingers appear as pixels.
  - People can join rooms different devices simultaneously.

***Basic Server Work / Rooms / Synchronized Metronome***
  - [] How to get metronomes syncing across a network?
       aesthetic.computer/metronome.180.red
       aesthetic.computer/metronome_300.yellow
       aesthetic.computer/metronome-180.black
       aesthetic.computer/metronome~180.blue

  Option 1: Visit rooms.ac to get a roomID which can be added to a command.
  Option 2: Automatically get a room with every new tab.
            - Join another room using `room roomID`.
            - Entering an activity is part of the room.
            - There should be a basic "shout" program for rooms.

 ***Socket Server*** 
  - [] Fix server.aesthetic.computer... maybe just take it offline for now?

***World***
 - [] Make an interconnected series of pieces that players can walk between, and
      maintain a server connection throughout.
 - [] Players should be able to wave or point their arm.

***Developer / User Login***
- [] Change the contents of user.aesthetic.computer/login.mjs to  ...
   - This would prompt the author to edit a string in login.mjs to match, which
     would grant them a javascript web token?.
   - Look up netlify identity... https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/identity

***Thumbnail Longtail***
  - [] Get the external thumbnail server running on a VPS to see how fast it is
       compared to the netlify function.
  - Provision a machine that can actually execute `npx playwright install chrome`.
  - [] Optimize netlify function... switch to jpeg to see if it's any faster? 

***Image Viewer / Media Viewer**
  - [] Write a great image-viewer that implements the `rdp` piece.
  - [] Also implement `tumpin`, `ten-minute-painting`, and `basedballz`.
  - [] Add my small series of Tezos 1of1s as well: `emokidpix` and `1bits`.

***Model Viewer***
 - [] Implement <model-viewer> for my 3d glb files so that when I share
      them to Twitter they can be in 3D, and also so that they can be wrapped
      as aesthetic.computer pieces.
      - https://modelviewer.dev/examples/twitter/generator.html

ü™ü Browser Quirks
  - [] Development server only: videos don't load in Firefox (tested on Windows). 2022.05.07.00.01
  - [] Make the cursor faster / match the speed of the native cursor.

***Transcribe the original Proce55ing typeface***

***Multi-player Drawing / Core Drawing***
  - [] Allow users to join / create rooms with codes (QR codes esp.)
  - [] Abstract `line` and `spline` into `nail`. See also: `gesture`.
  - [] Add sound to `nail`.
  - [] Use https://wicg.github.io/video-rvfc/ for video frame updates.

***No Paint***
  - [] Should the old nopaint.art be reachable from within aesthetic.computer
  - [] Should a new nopaint be built from scratch?

***Sidelight***
  - A light you can set the color off.
  - Make it flicker.
  - Have presets.
  - Very useful for making videos with an extra device!

üêû Annoying Bugs & Regressions ü™±
  - [] Alt / Meta shortcut needs to work for mac to reset pan.
  - [] Live reload: boot will not paint again if paint returns false in a contrived example
  + In Production
  - [] https://gist.github.com/lukaslihotzki/b50ccb61ff3a44b48fc4d5ed7e54303f
  - [] Zooming in on the page a lot will make the margin too large
       and squash the main display.
  + Dev Only
  - [] `sfx` do not decode in Safari when using the development servers.

  - [] Make a VSCode extension that opens an official aesthetic.computer pane?

üéÉ SETUP üíæ

`aesthetic.computer` is virtual computer environment / interface designed for
 creative exploration. development requires `nodejs`, an up-to-date web browser,
 and knowledge of javascript. if you're interested in learning how to contribute 
 visit https://discord.com/invite/aesthetic-computer and i'll help you out - jeffrey 2022.04.24.05.05

macOS from scratch
  1. Get 'homebrew' (https://brew.sh) and install 'fnm' (nodejs)

 Redis
  0. You may need to install `redis` to get the live reload working properly
     on local.
  1. You can use homebrew for this and a default install should be fine, so 
     long as `redis-cli` works.

Make sure `git` is installed, (you can do that through `homebrew`) and then get set up for development:
  0. Also install `fnm` the node version manager. (and add environtment variables to your shell: https://github.com/Schniz/fnm#shell-setup)
  0.0a Open new terminal window and cd into aesthetic.computer directory install node version 
  1. Check `ssl-dev/readme.txt` to generate and add local SSL certificates.
  2. `npm install` from the project directory.
  3. `cd` into `session-server` and `npm install` as well.
  4. Get added to the Netlify project as a collaborator.
  5. `cd` into `system` and run `npx netlify login` and then `npx netlify link`
  6. Now from the `aesthetic computer` directory run `npm run code` and in another shell `npm run server:session`.
  7. Visit `https://localhost:8888` to view the running site! 
  8. If you need local copies of the site's rich media `assets` then ask Jeffrey
     and you can slurp them from S3 so you can run the below.

Static Assets
  0. Squadmates can use `npm run assets:sync` after configuring `aws-cli` with
     the aesthetic.computer storage keys provided by Jeffrey.

üß© Making a new included piece.
- Run `npm run new name-of-your-piece Description of your piece.` 
- Then open the file in `system/public/aesthetic.computer/disks` and start working!

In production: Add a "#debug" hash to the end of your URL for more verbose output.

If developing: Add a "#nodebug" hash to the end of a URL for less output.

üìñ This project originally began as two separate repositories with their own
commit history: `digitpain/system` and `digitpain/disks`.
